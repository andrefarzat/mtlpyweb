A friend of mine jokes: "You should do the next one the day of the
Stanley Cup final" ... we will track the game close to live as we can :)
Here are the presentations for tonight. Asterisk and Python by Cyril
Robert Asterisk, allows the average user to do pretty much anything he
wants with his telephony system. It is open source and billed as the
"future of telephony". The first step in using asterisk is understanding
it correctly, which will be the first part of Cyril's lecture. The
second part will focus on how to take advantage of Python to make
asterisk a whole lot easier. PyQT and PyOpenGL: Live hacking a toy app
by Yannick Gingras. For the first 35 mins, Yannick will hack a toy app
from scratch using PyQt and PyOpenGL. After that, he will answer
questions for 10 minutes. -- Michael Deutsch also proposed we take a
look at the introduction by Guido Van Rossum of Google App Engine - if
we have time and if you guys want to :) See you all tonight.
