Step out of your buttermilk-induced coma, distutils2 needs you! We are
organizing a new packaging sprint on wednesday 2010-12-08, at Google's
office (1253 McGill College, suite 250). The distutils2 project is
progressing rapidly, and we must continue our effort. By the way, they
released their first alpha version not too long ago. We have 20 seats
available, and on top of it, Google will provide us with drinks and
food. If we're lucky, we might even have some of their famous baked
beans. Please write down your name in our wiki:
