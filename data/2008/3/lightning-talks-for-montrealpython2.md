As a result of brainstorming with fellow Montrealers Martin, Eric and
Vadim at PyCon, we are going to introduce lightning talks in our next
meetup. The idea is simple, attendees can volunteer to come up between
the first and second talk during the meetup and talk about how they use
of Python.

Simple and informal, these lightning talks are meant to inform each
other about how we use python, and eventually spark conversations.

What do you think?
