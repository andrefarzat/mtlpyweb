Our main preseter is going to be *Simon Law* and he is going to talk
about *Deploying scalable Web applications in Python*:

> Python Web applications are easy to build. There are lots of Web
> frameworks to choose and Python is a fast, easy language for creating
> large Web applications. However, deploying them is another matter. In
> this talk, you'll learn about the deployment of scalable Web
> applications: your options, the tradeoffs, and upcoming projects that
> will make the process more tractable.

> Simon Law is a jack-of-all-trades based in Montreal. He has deployed
> Python Web applications too many times for his own sanity. This talk
> is meant to help you retain yours.
