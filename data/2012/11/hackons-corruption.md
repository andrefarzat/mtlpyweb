Don't forget, this weekend, we are inviting you to participate to
**"Hackons la Corruption"** which will be held on November 10th and 11th
at the Centre communautaire de loisirs à Montréal (Sainte-Catherine
d'Alexandrie, 1700 Amherst Street.)

For the first time in Quebec, citizens will use their skills to fight
against corruption. The principal goal of this "hackathon" is to use new
technologies to find solutions to issues linked with public tenders,
contract attribution and public market management.

Each year, nearly 5 billion dollar are spent on infrastructure projects
in the province of Quebec. It's the perfect time to show us your
Pythoning skills while attempting to reduce the corruption that plagues
our system.

Québec Ouvert is proud to announce 3 prizes which will be given to the
best projects during the event:

-   Best project: 500$
-   Best project involving citizens: 250$
-   Best project to help researchers, journalism and cities: 250$

</p>
The jury will consist of Roberto Rocha (journalism, The Gazette), James
McKinney (director, Nord Ouvert), James Turk of the Sunlight Foundation,
and Jean Fortier (former presisent of the executive comitee of Montréal,
1998-2001.)
