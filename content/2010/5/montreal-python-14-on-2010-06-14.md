<!--:en-->The 14th Montréal-Python meeting will take place at UQAM on
June 14th, room SH-3420 of the [Sherbrooke building][] (200 Sherbrooke
west, metro Place-des-arts); it will be an entrepreneurial themed
meeting because we received many proposals on that theme and because we
sincerely believe that the best way to ensure that you are paid to code
in Python is to found your own job.

Here is our schedule for the evening:

-   18h20: Announcements
-   18h30: Flash presentations
-   19h00: Break

-   20h30: Discussions and refreshments at Benelux

Flash presenters will be:

-   Jeremy Barnes on Recoset
-   Chris Hart on the business value of Python
-   Michael Lenczner and Daniel Drouet on Ajah
