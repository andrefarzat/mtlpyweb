<p>Right after PyCon (victory!), I went to Seoul. Before leaving, I figured
"Hey, they may have a Seoul-Python or something!", so I looked around,
and found a forum: <a href="http://python.kr/">python.kr</a>.</p>
<p>I posted a message there introducing myself and asking if anyone wanted
to meet to discuss our favorite language. I got a few responses, and I
met 7 of them a few days ago.</p>
<p>[<img alt="" src="http://s2.i1.picplzthumbs.com/upload/img/53/a3/03/53a3031c2de706fb76528821cda964155577b1a4_wmeg.jpg" />][]</p>
<p>What surprised me at first was how similar to our community they all
were: they enjoy beer, and more than half of them were in startups, one
similar to groupon, and the other one is kind of a mix between
foursquare and kik.</p>
<p>One of the first things I asked was if they had regular meetings, much
like we do, and I was surprised that they didn't. They explained that in
2006, everyone wanted to do Python, so they held a conference in Seoul
that ended up attracting over 1500 programmers! They continued to
explain that Python was now the mainstream language, it is even taught
in their universities.</p>
<p>They concluded by saying that a community like ours was no longer
necessary, but a FAQ forum like they have now was more than enough.</p>
<p>I think we have a lot to do to reach that point, but it certainly gave
me hope!</p>
