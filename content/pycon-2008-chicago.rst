PyCon 2008 is coming up next week, and it's shaping up to be a great
event. You can find information at `http://us.pycon.org/2008/about`_/,
check out the blog `http://pycon.blogspot.com/`_ . There is also a
scheduler for the talks presented
`http://us.pycon.org/2008/conference/schedule/.`_

    PyCon 2008, to be held soon in the Chicago area, has over 950
    registered attendees at this time. That is over one and a half times
    the number of attendees from just the year before!

BTW. David Goodger who gave our first presentation ever is the Chair of
the conference.
