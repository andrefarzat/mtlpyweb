Here is a follow-up on Montréal Python 8. By popular demand, we will try
and do our best to post the slides and example files online after the
event.

Flash presenters at MP8 were:

-  Jennifer Bell: `visiblegovernment.ca`_ and `fixmystreet.ca`_ --
   Google Maps API and Geodjango (`slides`_, `code`_)
-  Sébastien Pierre: Pamela -- rediscovering the pleasure of
   hand-written HTML (`slides`_)
-  Francis Pieraut: follow-up on Digipy, the real time character
   recognition system presented at Montreal Python 6 (`slides`_)
-  Yannick Gingras: the Setuptools entry-points plugins system
   (`examples`_)

Our main presenter was *Alexandre Vassalotti* on *developing extension
modules for CPython* (`slides`_, `examples`_).

As we mentioned at MP8, Montreal Python is teaming up with PHP Québec
for the `PHP BBQ`_, which unfortunately we did not have time to rename
to something more language agnostic. The BBQ will take place at Parc du
Mont-Royal on 2009-08-08 at 13h. There will be a home brewed beer
contest between the PHP and the Python master brewers. I will proudly
represent the Montréal Python team with a keg of Pythoune Brune, a
fruity Belgian dark ale. Please confirm your presence by calling
514-581-8497 to make sure that there is enough food. Admission is only
$5.

Montréal-Python will take a break for the rest of the summer. We'll be
back on track in mid-September for MP9 with Andrew Francis who is going
to do a presentation on Stackless Python. We'll keep you posted as soon
as we have the final date and location.

As usual, we are still looking for presenter for both flash and main
presentations! Do not hesitate to contact us if you have an idea for a
presentation.

Montréal Python would like to thank our sponsors who made MP8 possible:

-  gold: `Département d'Informatique de l'UQAM`_
-  silver: `Pivotal Payments`_ and `Savoir-faire Linux`_
-  bronze: `O'Reilly`_ and `AESS`_

Thanks again to the presenters and to the attendees. See you at the BBQ.
