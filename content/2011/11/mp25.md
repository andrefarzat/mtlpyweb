<!--:en-->Python is a powerful agile language that surprises us by its
suppleness and the ease with which we can use it to solve complex
problems in just a few lines of code.

This month, we are exploring unexpected and unconventional uses of
Python across many domains. We are inviting you all to Inadvertent
Indentation, Monday Movember 21st at UQAM, in room SH-R810 of the
[Sherbrooke Pavillion][].

The even is free and even thought we will not serve a four course meal,
snacks will be provided. Rumor has it that there could also be some free
beer.

Here is our schedule for the night:

-   18h00: Opening
-   18h20: Announcements
-   18h30: First salvo
-   19h10: Pause

-   20h30: Discussions and refreshments at Benelux
