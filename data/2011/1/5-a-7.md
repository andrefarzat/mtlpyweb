<!--:en-->Our original plans for January were to have the meeting on the
17th but booking a room in a university at the beginning of the semester
is a non-trivial task, not quite unlike renewing an expired passport at
Complex Guy-Favreau. Facing the grim prospect of not drinking beer with
Pythonistas, we decided to invite you all for a very informal 5-à-7 on
2011-01-24 at Cheval Blanc. See you there.
