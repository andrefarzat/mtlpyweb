### Mission

Montréal-Python's mission is to promote the growth of a lively and
dynamic community of users of the Python programming language and to
promote the use of the latter. Montréal-Python also aims to disseminate
the local Python knowledge to build a stronger developer community.
Montréal-Python promotes Free and Open Source Software, favors its
adoption within the community, and collaborates with community players
to achieve this goal.

### Activities

We have regular meetings consisting of several short presentations
followed by a longer main presentation. Everyone if free to attend and
we often have snacks and drinks to foster a climate where discussions
are welcome and appreciated. No particular skill level is required to
enjoy the meetings since there is often a presentation for everyone,
from new comers to experts. Beside the regular meetings, we often
organize code sprints and informal gatherings. We are also part of the
core organization team of the [ConFoo conference][].

### Contact

We have a [mailing list][] which is relatively low volume, but has an
extremely high signal to noise ratio.  We also meet on irc, in
[\#montrealpython][] on freenode.net. We announce our meetings and other
activities on the mailing list and on this blog.
