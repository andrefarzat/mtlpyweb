<!--:en-->We live in Montréal and we hack Python code; this is who we
are. Right now, it just got event more exciting to be a hacker in this
city. We hack code, but when our code interacts with cool data, the
dance is a lot spicier. On Wednesday, the city of Montréal made us proud
by [releasing a lot of it's data][] under a very [permissive license][].
This is a first in the province of Québec.

Montréal-Ouvert has already been planing on [hacking on Saturday
November 19th][]. Now that it has become exciting with real data, we
want to make sure that there's going to be a lot of Python code written
there.

We don't know yet where the hackothon will take place, but we trust that
it's going to be near downtown, somewhere within walking distance from a
metro station. We will be there, and if you like to write Python code
and plan on being there, write you name in the comments below; we're
going to assemble a corrosive Python strike team.

Here's some ideas for cool projects we could undertake during this one
day event:

-   A site where people could suggest and vote on what dataset the city
    should release next. Think of something like Reddit or Ubuntu
    BrainStorm where someone could say "hey, I'd love to make a
    Patiner-Montreal clone for ski" or "let's make homebrewing more fun
    by indexing the water hardness data by burough."
-   A cross-correlation of the datasets already published; can we use
    the demographics data to visualize how many firemen there are per
    resident in all of our burrows? How about policemen per resident?
    What if we bring an extra dimension, like average revenue per
    burough?
-   An aggregator of existing and upcoming applications: a site where
    it's easy to see what everyone is doing with the open data of
    Montréal and with all sorts of metadata like the GitHub repo and the
    contribution process. Voting on the best applications would make it
    event more fun.
-   A flexible and intuitive calendar of the festivals and cultural
    events that makes is easy to browse by date, location and genre.
-   An integration of all this new smoking hot data with Open Street
    Maps. Mapify all the things!

So, we're going to be there. Who else is in?
