<!--:en-->This month, Montréal-Python (in conjunction with McGill's
[Network Dynamics][] lab) will let you discover your obsessions on
Twitter (or others' obsessions) by reading and analysing Twitter feeds
with Python. This second workshop of our Winter 2012 session will be the
occasion to discover new Python goodies while playing with data from
Twitter. Our workshops are open to all and absolutely **free**. No need
to have attended the previous one to attend this workshop. Only minimal
knowledge of Python is required (e.g: basic types). Bring your laptop
and try to have Python installed before the workshop. If you have
trouble with the installation, the Montréal-Python team will be able to
help at the very beginning of the workshop. Installation procedures and
all the information on this workshop are on the workshop's wiki page :
