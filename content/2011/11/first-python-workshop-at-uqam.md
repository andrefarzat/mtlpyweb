<!--:en-->Montréal-Python and UQAM's Association générale des étudiants
et étudiantes en informatique  (AGEEI, the student union of CS students)
are proud to announce their very first French open attendance Python
workshop.

You do not need to know any Python since this is going to be
an Introduction to Python session.

Our MC for the evening is going to be Davin Baragiotta, vice-president
of Montréal-Python and coordonator of information systems at
Agence Universitaire de la Francophonie (AUF).

The event is going to feature two parts:

-   The first part is going to bring us up to speed with the syntax,
    core data types, main modules of the standard library, and the
    intractive shell.
-   In the second part Davin will dive deep with a practical application
    of Python: building a Jabber bot.

The workshop is going to take place in room SH-R810 of the Shebrooke
building of UQAM on November 17 from 6h30 PM to 9h PM.

</p>
AGEEI will provide pizza and refreshments.
