<!--:en-->We learned a lot from [past sprints][] and we want to keep our
momentum so without waiting, we launch a 4th sprint on the Python
packaging system. The sprint will be on 2010-06-02 starting at 18h. It's
likely to be at Brasseurs Numériques' but we also have an altenate
location in sight. One way or the other, attendance will be limited to
around 12 to 18 hackers so [RSVP on the wiki][].

Bring your laptop or make a pairing arrangement on the mailing list
beforehand. We don’t have any sponsors for this sprint, but this won’t
stop us. Bring your refreshments and expect a group order for food
around 7pm.<!--:-->
