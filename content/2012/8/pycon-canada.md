Summer is ending and we're working hard to prepare you a rockingly
unique back to school time!

</p>

Well when we're gone, there ain't no stop! And that's why when our
siblings from Toronto launched **PyCon Canada** we really wanted to be
in it.

</p>

Indeed, the whole Canadian Pythonistas community is called to gather in
this first edition conference, from November 9th to 11th. Giving some
pep to the Canadian Python is a good step towards the **PyCon
Conference** that will be held here in Montreal in 2014-2015.

</p>

**Montréal-Python** will be there... will you?

</p>

The CFP is launched
-------------------

</p>
</p>

Regarding Montrealers at **PyCon**, we're counting on you to submit
proposals that will reflect the diversity and experience of our
community. Everyone is welcome, from the freshly initiated to the expert
willing to share its knowledge, we have interest in your experience!

</p>

Talks are 20 minutes long but 45 minutes talks will be taken in
consideration; not talking about the tutorials (3h). Sprints are also
welcome.

</p>

You can submit your talk on [PyCon Canada website][]. Otherwise, you can
submit it by email at this address :

</p>

[organizers@pycon.ca][]

</p>

Your talk proposition must have these informations :

-   Name of the talk or tutorial
-   Lenght of the talk/tutorial
-   Targeted audience (Diifficulty level)
-   Talk/tutorial abstract - 200 car. max

</p>
</p>

This fall, Toronto counts on you!
