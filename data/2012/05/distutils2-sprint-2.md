<!--:en-->The first [Distutils2 sprint][], held on the 21st of April at
[RadialPoint's][] office, was a real success. That afternoon marked the
renewal of Montréal-Python's contributions to this vital project of the
Python ecosystem. Indeed, two years ago, sprints were organized here at
the very beginning of Distutils2, which aims to replace Distutils with a
more powerful tool that implements the new specs (PEPs) that all
packaging tools will comply with in the long term. We're pleased that a
dozen of volunteers were part of this first sprint! I spent some time
with every participant and I think everyone learnt something from the
sprint, be it knowledge on packaging, a first experience in free
software development or the writing test suites. I'd like to thank
everyone who came and opened Pandora's Box in order to fix bugs for the
benefit of the whole community. The complexity of the code explains the
fact that only two patches were done at the end of the sprint, but the
other patches started by the other participants could certainly be
completed during the next one. In order to keep the pace, a second
sprint will be held *Saturday the 12th of May*. [TP1][] will host this
sprint and provide us with some pizza. Keep in mind that our deadline is
the release of the first beta version on the 24th of June. We have until
that point to close bugs and implement some useful features still
missing. **Contributing to Distutils2 will help the whole Python
community. Be part of it!** Second Distutils2 Sprint:

-   Date: Saturday, 12th of May 2012, from 12:00 to 19:00
-   Place: TP1, 1410 Stanley street, office 500 ([map][])
