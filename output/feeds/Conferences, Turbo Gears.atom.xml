&lt;p&gt;As we mentioned during the last Montréal-Python meeting, Chris
Perkins, core developer of TurboGears2, will be giving a one-day &lt;a href="http://confoo.ca/en/2010/session/relational-database-apps-with-turbogears"&gt;hands
on training on TurboGears2&lt;/a&gt; on March 9th. His tutorial covers several
parts of TurboGears2 that are common to Pylons so those who were
interested by the presentation by Alexandre Bourget will certainly get
the opportunity to dig deeper into Pylons and the other parts of the
WSGI ecosystem. At $300 and with the $100 rebate if you go to
conference, it's a real bargain.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>
