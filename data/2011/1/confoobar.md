<!--:en-->According to the success of our last 5-à-7 at Cheval Blanc,
we're forced to admit that Pythonistas are beer fans. Of course we like
to hang around together, we Pythonistas, but we shouldn't be afraid to
drop a pint whilst enjoying the company of coders from other horizons at
the traditional ConFooBar, the 5-à-7 evenings of the communities backing
[ConFoo][].

The next ConFooBar will be at the Ste-Elizabeth on 2011-02-18. Be
there.<!--:-->
