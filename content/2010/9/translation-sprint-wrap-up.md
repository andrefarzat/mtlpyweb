<!--:en-->The sixth event in our translation series took place on
2010-09-22, and it has been a very productive one.

A total of 2357 lines were translated, bringing 6 files to a complete
translation status. Mathieu Perrault deserves a special mention for
translating no less than 1133 lines all by himself. Beside actual
translation, Mathieu Leduc-Hamel and myself, Cyril, worked on a Pootle
tool-chain which should allow us to increase our productivity during the
upcoming sprints.

The sprint was hosted by [Google][], who also supported us with snacks,
pizzas, and drinks. Their M&M dispenser is always appreciated. WingWare
also supported our sprinting effort by providing all sprinters with a
full 3-OS license for [WingWare][]'s Python [IDE][].

The following sprinters were present:

-   Davin Baragiotta
-   Pior Bastida
-   Nicolas Cadou
-   Yannick Gingras
-   Ali Jetha
-   Mathieu Leduc-Hamel

-   Mathieu Perreault
