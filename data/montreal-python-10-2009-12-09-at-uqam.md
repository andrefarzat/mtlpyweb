Our main presenter will be *Chris Steel* and he's going to walk us
through *Universal Cake, a case study of using web2py for Web
development*.

> Universal Cake is that desert which taste good to everyone,
> everywhere, at any time. In terms of software it is the perfect
> application that comes in every language, is 100% accessible and is so
> easy to use that it you are unaware of the complexities it hides. It
> runs on any operating system and it does exactly what you want it to
> do. An interface to our current mixed media of radio waves, sound
> waves, electrons and increasingly photons, perhaps Marshall McLuhan
> would have describe it as frosting, or even the "skin" on our shiny
> new extended and now highly interconnected nervous system.

> Chris has a numbingly long and exceedingly diverse employment history
> that has become impossible to summarize. He currently provides
> contract services to the LED R&D branch of a medium sized US lighting
> company where he helped deploy their first digital signage network. At
> the moment, he is also in the process of launching a non-profit
> organization dedicated to promoting "fair access" to social, political
> and economic resources.

> Originally from the Washington D.C. area, he grew up in a tiny town
> that was full of journalists, scientists, musicians, professors,
> artists, lawyers and the most liberated mothers on the planet at the
> time. As the forests and farmlands surrounding their tiny town where
> bulldozed and the lakes filled in to create mega malls and shopping
> centers our town maintained it's independence by regularly and
> successfully battling to divert highways, national convenience store
> chains, incinerators and other threats to the towns integrity.

> Today, the front of most of the homes in the town still face the
> gravel "walkways" and communal green spaces are full of deer who no
> longer have any other place to go. The only clue that you are in the
> center of a high density population center is that in addition to the
> sound of the birds and children playing you can also hear the
> distinctive hum of the nearby "outer beltway".
