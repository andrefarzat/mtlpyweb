<!--:en-->One of the great thing with a booming city like Montréal is
that we get dynamic companies such as Google improving the synergy of
our community by hosting our sprints in bigger rooms and providing food
and refreshments.

Our next sprint will be on **Django translation** on September 22nd,
2010, starting at 18h30. Come and allow us to offer Django to a broader
community of developers.

Only one week after that, we'll host a sprint on the **Python packaging
system**. Come and frantically hack with us to empower Python with the
best packaging system out there.

Both sprints will be a Google, 1253 McGill College ave. suite \#250.

**Attendance is limited to 20 sprinters so don't forget to**[**RSVP on
the wiki**][]**.**<!--:-->
