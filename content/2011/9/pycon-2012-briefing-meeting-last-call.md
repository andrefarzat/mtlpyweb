<!--:en-->Hi all,

Montréal-Python is organizing a third meeting with our Pythonistas to
discuss about their talk proposals for PyCon 2012.

Wednesday 2011-10-05, 7:00 PM at Bénélux [1]

As reminded by Brian Curtin 2 days ago on this list [2], proposals for
PyCon are due for 2011-10-12.

We heard great ideas at the Bénélux last monday night. Other Pythonistas
are willing to help you get on stage at Santa Clara. Send your abstract
[3] (or not) somewhere like Sunday evening and show up (or not)
Wednesday at Bénélux.

We're all gonna make it happen! See you there!
