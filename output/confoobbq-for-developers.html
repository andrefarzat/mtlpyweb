<p><strong>update:</strong> Thanks to our generous sponsors Iweb and Microsost
Canada, the event is now free of charge.</p>
<p>PHP-Québec, Montréal-Python, Ruby Montréal, W3Qc, and OWASP Montréal are
glad to invite you to <a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=154314716205&amp;ref=nf">ConFooBBQ</a>, the BBQ for developers.</p>
<p>Inspired by PHP-Québec's legendary PHP-BBQ, ConFooBBQ offers a unique
opportunity to relax and enlarge your network of developers and other
actors of the various web development communities in Montréal.</p>
<p>In addition to the traditional hot-dogs, ConFooBBQ will feature the
first edition of ConFooBrew, a home brewing contest for geeks! Each user
group has the opportunity to elect a master brewer who will represent
them with a batch of homebrew beer. Come and taste geek brews such as
Hopecode Cache and Pythoune Blanche.</p>
<p>ConFooBBQ will take place in Mont Royal Park, near Smith House on Sunday
September 13th at 1h00 pm. ConFooBBQ is a family event; spouses and
children are all welcome.</p>
<p>The cost for the food will be \$0. On the menu: hot-dogs, chips, salad,
soft drinks, cookies, and lots of fun. Food and participation prices are
generously offered by Iweb and Microsoft Canada.</p>
<p>If you plan to eat, please confirm your presence by sending an email to
board@confoo.ca. Don't forget to include your name, the number of
persons, and, ideally, a phone number where we can reach you. No
reservation is required for enjoying the ConFooBrew beer contest.</p>
<p>If you cannot find the location, feel free to call Yann Larrivée at
514-581-8497 or Yannick Gingras at 541-800-0138.</p>
<p>The user groups that are involved with ConFooBBQ would also like to
announce the ConFoo.ca conference, the largest event on Web development
in North America. ConFoo.ca is launching its <a href="http://confoo.ca/en/cfp">call for speakers</a> this
week, more details are available on the <a href="http://confoo.ca/en/cfp">website</a>.</p>
<p>Looking forward to see you there.</p>
