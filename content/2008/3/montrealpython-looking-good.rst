Welcome to our new identity.

We owe this identity to `Hamish Macpherson`_who did a wonderful job. I
encourage everyone to thank him and tell him how awesome he is.

Remember that the next meetup is coming April 10th and please invite
anyone who needs to be invited.

If you haven't signed up on the `wiki`_, please do it now.
