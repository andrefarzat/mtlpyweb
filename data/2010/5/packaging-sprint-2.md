Thanks to [Tarek][]'s coaching during the last packaging sprint, many of
us were able to undertake a journey deep into the Python packaging
internal and to hack some code that is now widely deployed, such as the
[PyPI site][] itself. This is great and we don't want to stop there.

Next Monday, on 2010-05-10, we'll have a sprint on Packaging at
Brasseurs Numériques' office: 1124 Marie-Anne, suite 11, from 18h30
until 1am or something very close to it. This is a sprint for anyone who
deploys or installs Python packages and there is a very wide range to
tasks that that we can undertake, from documentation to core code on the
Python 3 branch.

Bring your laptop or make a pairing agreement on the mailing list before
hand. Attendance is limited to 12 sprinters so please [RSVP on the
wiki][]. We don't have a sponsor this time but that won't stop us. Bring
your own drinks and expect a group order for food arond 19h.
