Grig Gheorghiu from SoCal piggies says:

    We had the SoCal Piggies meeting at the Disney Animation Studios
    last night. It was a great meeting -- great presentations from
    Disney engineers on how they use Python at Disney (and they use it A
    LOT!), great food, great turnout, and great atmosphere. Let me tell
    you -- the Disney Animation Studios are \*lush\*. Thanks to Paul
    Hildebrandt for organizing the meeting.

    I'll probably blog separately about the technical content of the
    presentations, but for now I just wanted to comment on the fact that
    everybody seems to be hiring Python programmers -- `Gorilla Nation`_
    and `Virgin Charter`_ are just two companies in the L.A. area that
    are aggressively looking to hire Python talent. Another thing: we
    used to have difficulties in finding venues for our meetings. We
    used to meet at either USC or Caltech, and around 10-12 people max.
    would show up. Now companies are clamoring for organizing the
    meetings at their offices, and we have 20-30 people in the audience,
    with many new faces at every meeting. Even more: Ruby on Rails
    programmers are showing up at our meetings, looking for an
    opportunity to be more involved with Python!

    I take that as a sign that Python has arrived. It's a good time to
    be a Python programmer
