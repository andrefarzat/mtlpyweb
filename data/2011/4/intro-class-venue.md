<!--:en-->The response has been amazing so far for the [Introduction to
Programming with Python class][] we announced earlier this month. So
amazing, in fact, that we had to temporarily close off registration
while we booked a new venue. Good news, though, registration has been
re-opened, and those of you who were on the waiting list have now been
put on the guestlist. We have also chosen a location â€” room **SH-2420**
of the [Sherbrooke pavilion][] at UQAM. Wi-fi will be provided. Looking
forward to seeing you all there!
