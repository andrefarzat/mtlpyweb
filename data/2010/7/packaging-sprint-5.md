<!--:en-->Summer is going strong with lots of good opportunities for
terraces but we know that beer always feel better after accomplishing
something great. This is why we will have a fifth sprint on the Python
packaging system next Monday, 2010-07-05. The sprint will be at
Brasseurs Numériques, 1124 Marie-Anne, suite 11, starting at 6h30 pm and
going as long as there are hackers standing. Bring your own laptop or
make an arrangement for pairing on the mailing list beforehand.
Attendance is limited to 12 persons so please [RSVP on the wiki][].
**update:** We thank the [Python Software Foundation][] for supporting
our sprinting effort by supplying food and drinks. You probably recall
that not long ago, the PSF [announced][] that it would start a sprint
sponsorship program. Montréal-Python is honored to be the first
recipient of the program.
