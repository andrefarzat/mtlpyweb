<!--:en-->The Python Software Foundation is announcing a new sprint
sponsorship programme : Announcing: [Python Sprint Sponsorship][].
Montreal Python's short yet intense sprint experienceÂ  gathered
pythonistas of all levels in contributing to Python's ecosystem in
different ways, such as Django documentation's translation, Packaging
and Turbogears2. Sprint sponsorship is good news that should enable us
to do more sprints on a wider range of topics.
