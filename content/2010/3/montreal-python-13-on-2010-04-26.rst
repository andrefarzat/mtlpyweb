Montréal-Python 13 will take place at UQAM, on Monday 2010-04-26 in room
SH-3420 of the Sherbrooke building. The SH building is located at `200
Sherbrooke west`_, Place-des-Arts metro station. Here is our schedule
for the evening:

-  18h00: Opening
-  18h20: Announcements
-  18h30: Flash presentations
-  19h00: Break
-  19h20: Main presentation
-  20h30: Discussions and refreshments at Benelux

Flash Presenters will be:

-  Hao Deng on Pointfree Functional Programming in Python
-  Pierre Thibault on ipython
-  Alexandre Bourget on WebUndo
-  Sébastien Pierre on a surprise topic
-  Yannick Gingras on the Montréal-Python wiki

Our main presenter is going to be *Andrew Francis* and he’s going to
talk about *Implementing Go's select in Stackless Python*.

    Google's introduction of the Go language raised eyebrows in the
    Stackless Python community. Although very different languages, Go
    and Stackless Python's concurrency model share a common ancestor:
    the Bell Labs family of languages (i.e., Newsqueak, Limbo). The
    common feature are channels: a synchronous message passing mechanism
    based on Tony Hoare's Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP).

    Both Go and Python have channels. However with the select language
    statement. Go has the ability to wait on multiple channels
    simultaneously. Stackless Python does not have this feature.

    This talk discusses implementing a Select like feature in Stackless
    Python. The technique will be to prototype the feature with
    stackless.py - the PyPy's project implementation of Stackless Python
    written in Python!

    Along the way, audience will learn Stackless Python basics and get a
    glimpse at greenlets and PyPy. In the process, the audience will see
    how Stackless Python's API reflects philosophical differences
    between Go and Stackless Python's approach to concurrency.

    Living in Montréal, Andrew Francis has an academic background in the
    humanities, computer science, and management. Professionally, Andrew
    has worked at companies such as BNR, Omnimark, and Adobe Systems in
    California. Ever since 2005, Andrew has been playing with Stackless
    Python, as a part of his work with WS-BPEL, and he has never looked
    back! At Pycon 2008, Andrew gave the talk “Adventures in Stackless
    Python/Twisted Integration.”
