<!--:en-->[![McGill Python Workshop][]][] On Wednesday March 23rd was
held the first of what is sure to be a series of Python workshops held
at McGill University. Organized by Professor Derek Ruths and I of Ruths
Research ([http://ruthsresearch.org][]), the workshop attracted more
than 80 attendees, most of them students from McGill University. The
purpose of this first Python workshop was to introduce attendees to the
simplicity of working with the language. Professor Ruths started the
session by talking about some of the reasons people are choosing Python
over other languages: easiness in learning the language, the amazing
power it has under the hood and the speed with which one can go from
idea to prototype. He then introduced the containers that are built in
to the language (list, dict, set, tuple) and presented ways that code
can be made simpler and more readable using standard methods on these
containers. I then built, in front of the audience, an application that
interfaced with the Twitter API. This allowed me to introduce great
modules that are offered with Python: urllib and json. Attendees were
guided through the steps of working with an API (from reading the
documentation to making a GET request) and shown how simple it is to get
from an idea to a working Python program in less than 30 minutes.
Overall the organizers were quite pleased with the event and plan to
organize more of them in the future. Materials from this last event can
be found on their website ([http://ruthsresearch.org/mpw][]).
