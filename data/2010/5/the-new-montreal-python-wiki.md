Some of you may have noticed that last week a new 'Wiki' link popped up
on our blog's top menu bar. We wanted to have a wiki for a few reasons:

-   RSVP'ing for sprints.
-   Keeping an archive of past events, eventually with links to
    presentation slides, etc.
-   Having a kind of "Who's who" of the local Python companies and
    developers.
-   Providing tips and resources for presenters.

</p>
It's still a bit sketchy in some areas and most pages need some fleshing
out but we have a good basis for a great resource. The section that
could use the most contribution is probably the [tips and tricks for
speakers][]. With all the flash presentations that we've had, the local
crowd must have accumulated a lot of knowledges on the tools that ensure
a smooth experience and this is worth sharing with the future speakers.
The focus is not limited to tools; tips and resources on how to
structure a presentation and on public speaking are all welcome.

So, go ahead and have a look, improve the content, add your company to
the list, and have fun

Please keep the point of view neutral and any listing in alphabetical
order.
