<!--:en-->Montréal-Python 12 will take place at UQAM, on Monday
2010-03-22 in room SH-3420 of the Sherbrooke building. The SH building
is located at [200 Sherbrooke west][], Place-des-Arts metro station.
Here is our schedule for the evening:

-   18h00: Opening
-   18h20: Announcements
-   18h30: Flash presentations
-   19h00: Break
-   19h20: Main presentation
-   20h30: Discussions and refreshments at Benelux

Flash presenters will be:

-   Antoine Reversat -- Python for Sysadmins
-   Francis Piéraut -- Jython and Tomcat
-   Sébastien Pierre -- Rugg: crash-testing for your hard drives
-   Hadrien David -- Déploiement sur AppEngine
-   Gary Haran -- Montreal, from Ghetto to Hub

Our main presenter is going to be *Marcin Swiatek* and he's going to
talk about *Generating control images for microscopy software with
Python and Numpy*.

> Numpy is the mainstay of all things numerical in Python. I will use
> one of my past projects – a pipeline for testing image analysis
> software – to introduce [Numpy][]. The presentation will focus on
> basic array manipulation, random number generators, and elementwise
> operations. Real math will be given silent treatment. PIL, or [Python
> Imaging Library][] will appear in a supporting role.

> Marcin has been working on development of life sciences software for
> the past 12 years. He has been a Python user since the version 1.5.2.
