<!--:en-->Last week we got the resignation from Montréal Python's
founder, [Arach Tchoupani][]. This resignation prompted us to open the 3
officer positions, and proceed to run an election. All active members of
the organizing committee were eligible to vote.

The results are in, and we're very proud to introduce the new Montréal
Python officers:

-   [Yannick Gingras][], reelected President
-   [Cyril Robert][], Vice-President
-   [Pior Bastida][], Treasurer

<!-- p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Arial} -->We
all look forward to give one another year of dynamic events that will
put forward how Python is shaping the tech scene of Montréal.
