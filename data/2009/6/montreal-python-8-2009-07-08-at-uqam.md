Greetings Pythonistas of Montréal, we have the pleasure to announce that
Montréal Python 8 will take place at UQAM on Wednesday 2009-07-08. The
event will be in room SH-2420 of the [Sherbrooke building][], located at
200 Sherbrooke west

Here is our schedule for the evening:

-   18h00: Opening
-   18h20: Announcements
-   18h30: Flash presentations
-   19h00: Break
-   19h20: Main presentation

Our main presenter will be *Alexandre Vassalotti* on *developing
extension modules for CPython*

> Python makes an excellent glue language to connect software
> components. The CPython interpreter can easily be extended to provide
> new ways to manipulate and combine your programs and libraries.
>
> The core of the talk will be on how to develop extension modules for
> CPython using its C API. The presentation will also give insights how
> to write Python code which makes efficient use of the CPython
> interpreter.
>
> Please note that the audience will be expected to have a basic
> understanding of the C language. However, people who do not know C
> will probably still enjoy the commentaries about the design of the
> CPython interpreter and the overview of the alternative techniques
> available for extending it.
>
> Alexandre Vassalotti is a contributing Python core developer and a
> computer science student at McGill University. He was a successful
> participant of Google Summer of Code 2007, for which he worked on the
> different aspects of Python 3.0.

We still have a few open slots for flash presentations so don't hesitate
to propose a talk. Also, our speaker pool is running low so please get
in touch with us if you have an idea for a main presentation.
