<!--:en-->PyCon and ConFoo published their schedule recently and now is
probably the time to decide where you're going to go because you have
until next week to benefit from the early bird rate at both conferences.
If you don't want to miss Raymond Hettinger showing us how to have [Fun
with Python's Newer Tools][], then get [your ticket for PyCon][] before
next Tuesday. On the other hand, if you want to see Blaise Laflamme give
an [Introduction to Pyramid][], then you should [register for ConFoo][]
before next Friday. Of course, those who are not faint of heath will
want to go to both conferences. Will you dare?
