It took some time, but at last, the videos of Montréal-Python 10 are
finaly online. It took some time but the waiting was well worth it
because our new video editing pipeline is a lot more efficient and it
allows us to not only publish the main presentation but the lightning
talks too.

But wait, there's more. Given the curent ongoing debate on Flash vs open
formats, we decided to more forward and to ditch our current hosting
provider in favor of an homegrown solution that allows streaming without
Flash, in Theora on supported browsers.

Ain't that great? Yeah, we thought so too, that's why we decided to post
the annoucement before the trancoding was entirely done. So don't worry
if you don't see all the videos from Montréal-Python 10 yet; they will
all show up before the end of the week (or not very long after that).
That's it for now; stay tuned for the rest of the videos. In the mean
time, enjoy:
