<!--:en-->This 5th Django sprint at the Google office wraps-up on a
great conclusion: things are moving forward! This is 951 new lines
translated by our 6 sprinters:

-   Davin Baragiotta
-   Pior Bartida
-   Alexandre Bourget
-   Nicolas Cadou
-   Yannick Gingras
-   George Peristerakis
-   Pierre Phaneuf (from Google)

This new effort of translation brings the French translation coverage of
the Django 1.2 documentation up to 18%. We estimate that 77% of the
French translation has been made by pythonistas of Montr√©al.

-   11314 lines translated (18%)
-   52731 lines waiting for translation

Of the translated lines,

-   8759 are by Montreal-Python
-   2624 are by the Django-fr team

Their is still a long road ahead but the Montreal-Python team is more
and more efficient and we hope to see you at the next sprint. Thanks a
lot to [AUF][] for the food and to Google and especially to Pierre
Phaneuf ([@pphaneuf][]) for hosting us during those crazy six hours.
