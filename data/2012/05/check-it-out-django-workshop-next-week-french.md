League needs your help! Here comes your confrontation with Django... a
bit postponed since we absolutely wanted to hold this event in a UQAMian
stadium. If bad weather occurs, we've took our dispositions : we've
found a covered stadium near UQAM. So, let's stop kidding, here's what
you need to know about our last workshop **in French** of the Winter
2012 Session : **Django : monter une application web en Python**

-   Date: Wednesday 16th of May, from 6:00 PM to 9:00 PM
-   Place: UQAM (hourra!), Sherbrooke Building, 200 Sherbrooke West,
    room **SH-2420**
-   Subscription: on [Eventbrite][]
