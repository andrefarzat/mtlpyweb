<!--:en-->We are here today with solomn hearts, dear friends. As many of
you may know, our previous president Yannick "What these glasses?!"
Gingras will be leaving Montréal for the warmer pastures of San
Francisco to work for none other than the one... Facebook. It is indeed
a great loss for Montréal Python, our city itself and all of us who call
Yannick a friend. It's also a pretty severe loss for all the brew-pubs
in <del datetime="2011-11-11T15:04:22+00:00">Montréal</del>
<del datetime="2011-11-11T15:04:22+00:00">Québec</del> Canada. And yet,
it is an exceptionally exciting move for Yannick; he has the opportunity
to bring Python to something that millions of people use every day. And
so, with Yannick leaving and the winter just starting, what better time
to celebrate - a sort of melancholy celebration - but a celebration
nonetheless. The plan: Wednesday, November 16th from 17h to "19h" at our
staple, Benelux. Join your fellow Pythonistas to wish Yannick a
fantastic adventure and solidify his belief that Montréal Python is an
amazing usergroup capable of amazing things. See you there !
