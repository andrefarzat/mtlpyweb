<!--:en-->[TurboGears][] is organizing a [sprint on Black Friday][] to
give the final polish for the 2.1 release. Montréal-Python invites you
join to the sprinting effort at [Café Fractal][] located in room SH-R380
of the [Sherbrooke building][] from 4pm to 11pm. We plan to have at
least two persons somewhat familiar with the TurboGears 2.1 code base on
site. They will be able to help you setup your development environment,
coach you with the tools, and introduce you to TurboGears in general.
