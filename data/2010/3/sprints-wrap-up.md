We recently held both a Distribute and a TurboGears sprint and both were
really successful.

The TurboGears sprint, mentored by [Chris Perkins][], was the most
informal and probably the hardest to contribute to but we still got a
very good participation. Sprinters were:

-   Alice Bevan-McGregor
-   Nicolas Cadou
-   Yannick Gingras
-   Mathieu Leduc-Hamel
-   Chris Perkins
-   Antoine Pitrou
-   Alexandre Vassalotti
-   Tarek Ziadé

The Distribute sprint was shorter but since packagin touches everyone,
it was expected that more people would show up. [Tarek Ziadé][] did a
good introduction to get everyone up to speed and he was very pro active
with the coaching. Tarek has a longer [write-up of the Distribute
sprint][] on his blog.

Distribute sprinters were:

-   Ahmed Al-Saadi
-   Davin Baragiotta
-   Nicolas Cadou
-   Yannick Gingras
-   Mathieu Leduc-Hamel
-   Thomas Noël
-   Antoine Pitrou
-   Jean Schurger
-   Alexandre Vassalotti
-   Tarek Ziadé

Both sprints were held at Brasseur Numériques' office and [Ubity,
provider of VoIP solution in Montréal][], deserves a special thank for
supplying the food for the Distribute sprint.

It turns out that sprints are a very effective way to get our local
Pythonistas to work together and to share tips on how to be efficient
with Python. Stay tuned because we will certainly organize more of
these.
