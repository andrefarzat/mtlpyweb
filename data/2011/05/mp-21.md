We are happy to announce that Montréal-Python 21, aka Eruptive Exorcist,
will take place Monday the 9th. This gives us the opportunity to invite
some of the LGM people to come over and talk to us about graphics stuff!
 The meeting will be in room SH-3140 of the [UQAM Sherbrooke

developers and users of Free, Libre and Open Source graphics software.
This year, it will be held in Montréal, from May 10th to 13th. LGM also
is completely free, it's going to be held at [École Polytechnique de
Montréal][]. It's free, and we encourage you to attend! We're going to
