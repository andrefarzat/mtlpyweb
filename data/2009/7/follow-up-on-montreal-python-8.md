<!--:en-->Here is a follow-up on Montréal Python 8. By popular demand,
we will try and do our best to post the slides and example files online
after the event. Flash presenters at MP8 were:

-   Jennifer Bell: [visiblegovernment.ca][] and [fixmystreet.ca][] --
    Google Maps API and Geodjango ([slides][], [code][])
-   Sébastien Pierre: Pamela -- rediscovering the pleasure of
    hand-written HTML ([slides][1])
-   Francis Pieraut: follow-up on Digipy, the real time character
    recognition system presented at Montreal Python 6 ([slides][2])
-   Yannick Gingras: the Setuptools entry-points plugins system
    ([examples][])

Our main presenter was *Alexandre Vassalotti* on *developing extension
modules for CPython* ([slides][3], [examples][4]). As we mentioned at
MP8, Montreal Python is teaming up with PHP Québec for the [PHP BBQ][],
which unfortunately we did not have time to rename to something more
language agnostic. The BBQ will take place at Parc du Mont-Royal on
2009-08-08 at 13h. There will be a home brewed beer contest between the
PHP and the Python master brewers. I will proudly represent the Montréal
Python team with a keg of Pythoune Brune, a fruity Belgian dark ale.
Please confirm your presence by calling 514-581-8497 to make sure that
there is enough food. Admission is only $5. Montréal-Python will take a
break for the rest of the summer. We'll be back on track in
mid-September for MP9 with Andrew Francis who is going to do a
presentation on Stackless Python. We'll keep you posted as soon as we
have the final date and location. As usual, we are still looking for
presenter for both flash and main presentations! Do not hesitate to
contact us if you have an idea for a presentation. Montréal Python would
like to thank our sponsors who made MP8 possible:

-   gold: [Département d'Informatique de l'UQAM][]
-   silver: [Pivotal Payments][] and [Savoir-faire Linux][]
-   bronze: [O'Reilly][] and [AESS][]

Thanks again to the presenters and to the attendees. See you at the BBQ.
