[Notman House][] a brand new hub of the local startup world, is just
getting started and even though its air conditioning is not quite
functional yet, that won't stop us. The [expert pythonistas][] [from
Montréal][] who are going to [talk at ConFoo][] [and at PyCon][] are
going to do a dress rehearsal there next Wednesday at 6h30 PM and if you
are fast, you could be part of the test audience.

In front of this small public, our star presenters are going to preview
their talk and receive some critical feedback that should give the
official public performance this extra umph that makes you spill your
pint. If you want to be part of the crowd, [RSVP on the wiki][].
