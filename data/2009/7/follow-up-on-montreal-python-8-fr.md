Here is a follow-up on Montréal Python 8. By public demand, we will do
our best to re-post the slides and example files online after the event.
Flash presenters at MP8 were:

-   Jennifer Bell: [visiblegovernment.ca][] and [fixmystreet.ca][] --
    Google Maps API and Geodjango ([slides][], [code][])
-   Sébastien Pierre: Pamela -- rediscovering the pleasure of
    hand-written HTML ([slides][1])
-   Francis Pieraut: follow-up on Digipy, the real time character
    recoginition system presented at Montreal Python 6 ([slides][2])
-   Yannick Gingras: the Setuptools entry-points plugins system
    ([examples][])

Our main presenter was *Alexandre Vassalotti* on *developing extension
modules for CPython* ([slides][3], [examples][4]). As mentioned, we
Montreal Python teams up with PHP Québec for the [PHP BBQ][], which
unfortunately we did not have time to rename to something more language
agnostic. The BBQ will take place at Parc du Mont-Royal on 2009-08-08 at
13h. There will be a home brew beer contest between the PHP master
brewer and the Python master brewer. I will proudly represent the
Montréal Python team with a keg of Pythoune Brune, a fruity Belgian dark
ale. Please confirm your presence by calling 514-581-8497 to make sure
that there is enough food. Admission is only $5. Montréal-Python will
take a break for the rest of the summer. We get back on track in
mid-September with Andrew Francis who is going to do a presentation on
Stackless Python. We keep you posted as soon as we have the final date
and location. As usual, we are still looking for presenter for both
flash and main presentation. Do not hesitate to contact us if you have
an idea for a presentation. Montréal Python would like to thank the
sponsors who made MP8 possible:

-   gold: [Département d'Informatique de l'UQAM][]
-   silver: [Pivotal Payments][] and [Savoir-faire Linux][]
-   bronze: [O'Reilly][] and [AESS][]

Thanks again to the presenters and to the attendees. See you at the BBQ.
