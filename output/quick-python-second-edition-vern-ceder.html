<p><strong>Disclaimer: This review is for the paper version only.</strong></p>
<p>This is a review of <strong>The Quick Python Book *second edition.</strong>* by Vern
Ceder at Manning Publications. The book is an introduction to Python
with the focus on the core language features. There is what did I think
of the book.</p>
</p>

<h2>Short Answer:</h2>
</p>

<p>The book does a great job overall to bring you up to speed on how to
program in Python in a pythonic way.</p>
</p>

<h2>Long Answer:</h2>
</p>

<p>The author makes some assumptions about its audience. First, you must
have grasped the concept of object oriented design and data structures.
Because the book avoids the theoretical explanations and goes directly
to the implementation.</p>
</p>

<p>When you first pick up the book, you will notice how thin it is compared
to other introduction books. And that is because it is terse in
presenting the content and examples. The focus is the core Python
language and some commonly used libraries found in the standard library.
The book also covers some rudimentary GUI programming using TKinker,
just enough to create a simple form. The book follows the same
rudimentary explanation with the database and networking chapter. The
book's strong points are its thorough explanation of the core language
and program structure. Which in turn, promotes a pythonic way of
programming and engineering your code.</p>
</p>

<p>At the end of the book, the reader will have learned to implement a
modular tested python application whether it be a desktop or a daemon,
which can distribute and run anywhere.</p>
</p>

<p>The only problem I have with the book is it does not provide links to
reference sites. You could argue that those links are supplemental, but
for an introduction book, the links are essential to complete the
chapters. Also, adding syntax highlighting to aide in reading the
example code, would make following the code easier.</p>
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
</p>

<p>Overall, I'm happy with the book. If you are a programmer with some
experience and interested in learning Python, I highly recommend this
book.</p>
</p>

book. For more information, you should refer to the Manning
