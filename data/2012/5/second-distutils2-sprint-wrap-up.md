![TP1 logo][] The second event in our series of Distutils2 sprints was
again a success. We've managed to fix some interesting issues and we've
gained some experience points at dealing with the black magic of the
packaging arcane.

We would like to thank [TP1][] for hosting the sprint at their nice
Downtown Montreal offices and also for the pizza. Pierre Paul, our host,
wrote [a longer post][] relating the event.

Stay tuned for upcoming announcements on Distutils2 sprints.

Special thanks to the sprinters:

-   Julien Courteau
-   Jonathan Fernandes
-   Patrice Gauthier
-   Mathieu Leduc-Hamel
-   Pierre Paul Lefebvre
-   Alex Parij
-   Kim Pettersen

</p>
Stay tuned this week for the announcement of the next sprint.

Here's a glimpse of patches being born:
