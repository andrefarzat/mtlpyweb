<!--:en-->This wednesday, September the 21st, Montréal-Python calls you
to a briefing meeting for PyCon 2012.

Montréal's full of good Python developers indeed and that's why you won
PyCon 2014-2015. It's now time to prove it to the rest of the World.
Come meet us at Devlab, métro Square-Victoria, to discuss about your
presentations and what we will show at Santa-Clara.

Don't worry, few beers are awaiting to refresh up conversations and if
you're one of the happy few owning tickets for Arcade Fire the same
evening, you might be able to see the end of the first part.

Let's meet this wednesday 21st at Devlab at 6:30pm, 388 Saint-Jacques
street, métro Square-Victoria.<!--:-->
