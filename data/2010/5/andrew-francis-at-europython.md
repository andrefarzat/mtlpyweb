Andrew Francis, who did the main presentation at [Montréal-Python 13][],
will be presenting at [EuroPython][]. His talk on [Implementing Go's
Select][] will be a slightly shorter version of the one that he did at
Montréal-Python. It's good to see fellow Montréalers presenting at large
international conferences.
