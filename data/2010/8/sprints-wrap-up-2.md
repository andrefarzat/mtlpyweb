The past month was busy with two programming sprints. The seventh in our
packaging series took place on 2010-07-29 and the and eighth was on
2010-08-05. We were planing on having a translation sprint on 2010-08-03
but we faced extreme competition from the excellent weather so it got
cancelled for lack of participants. Hopefully, fall will be bring us
back to our previous attendance levels.

The seventh sprint was at [Brasseurs Numériques][] with the following
sprinters:

-   Éric Araujo (remote from France)
-   Nicolas Cadou
-   Alex Gal
-   Yannick Gingras
-   Alok Mohindra
-   George Peristerakis
-   Luis Rojas

It was good to have Éric brave the time zone gap and to sprint with us
until the early morning in his hometown. Most of the crew worked on
improving the test coverage and Alex got to make some progress towards
using [argparse][] instead of getopt for command line arguments.

The eighth sprint was at the Montréal office of Google with the
following sprinters:

-   Éric Araujo (remote from France)
-   Alex Gal
-   Yannick Gingras
-   Pierre Phaneuf
-   Antoine Reversat
-   Luis Rojas

Google's very stylish office is always very welcoming with extra perks
such as easy access to the M&M dispenser. Watching the crowd at the
outdoor fashion show bellow run for cover during the storm certainly
confirmed that it was better to be sprinting than to be drinking on
terraces.

Éric decided to stay up late for that sprint too, which really helped
us. Most people worked on unit tests, Alex kept working on the argparse
integration, and and Antoine improved the [PEP-8][] compliance of the
code.

We will take a break for the rest of the summer but stay tuned for more
sprints in September.
