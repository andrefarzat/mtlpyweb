<p>Last Monday was a hot and sticky day here in Montréal, one of
these days when air feels as dense as molasses, when grocery stores run
out of ice cream. Yet, a handful of brave Pythonistas decided to brave
the heat and to head out to <a href="http://ajah.ca/blog">Brasseurs Numériques</a> for the fifth
Montréal-Python <a href="http://montrealpython.org/2010/07/packaging-sprint-5/">sprint on the Python packaging system</a>. The turn out
was a bit low compared with previous sprints but this is easily
explained by the many regulars who are traveling abroad during the
summer. We were also happy to welcome a few new comers. We took a moment
at the white-board to review what was the state of the Python packaging
and to define the aspects on which everyone could be contributing. Alex
and Nicolas worked on improving the test coverage in distutils2, a very
good way of getting familiar with the code while diving in right away;
I, Yannick, gave them a hand by adding test coverage reports as a
command line option to the test runner; George and Pior worked on 2to3
migration fixers and on the related test suite; and Davin improved the
Hitchhiker's Guide to Packaging while Michel helped him by packaging a
package of his own while following the guide, making sure that the
documentation was clear and obvious. Thanks to the sprinters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Davin Baragiotta</li>
<li>Pior Bastida</li>
<li>Nicolas Cadou</li>
<li>Alex Gal</li>
<li>Michel Gallant</li>
<li>Yannick Gingras</li>
<li>George Peristerakis</li>
</ul>
<p>I also want to personally thank everyone for taking the time to clean
their glasses and plates as they were leaving. It was refreshing not to
have to do most of the cleanup myself at 1am. We're becoming productive
during our sprints. One thing that we overlooked when we started
sprinting at Montréal-Python is how important it is to have a coach,
that is, someone who knows the project reasonably well and who will
answer questions from other sprinters. Theoretically, a bunch of hackers
could work together, dive in, pry open, and figured out a project as
they go. In practice, that does not work very well for a sprint since
you get a bunch of people who are not used to work together and the kind
of close communication that you need for pair investigation does not
have time to kick in during the relatively short sprint. As people are
waiting for the investigators to come up with answers to their
questions, their excitement dissipates and they get kicked out of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">the
zone</a>. Another thing that really helps is to have possible tasks with
a wide range of difficulty to allow anyone to get busy. An example of
great introductory task, as mentioned earlier, is writing unit-test.
This requires that setting up a working test environment and producing a
coverage report is straight forward and this is what a someone should
keep in mind before launching a sprint on a given project. As it takes
some time to setup and to get focussed, one way to improve productivity
is to have longer sprint. Hacking during the week-end, especially during
nice summer days, is not very popular but dedicated hackers will show
up. A good balance between week-days and weekend sprints is key here.
Another way to improve is to nail down as many "boiler plate" tasks as
possible before the sprint: creating all the Bitbucket accounts and
distributing the necessary privileges, assigning tasks, or even setting
up a working tests environment. We have to thank the Python Software
Foundation for <a href="http://pythonsprints.com/2010/07/4/our-first-sponsored-sprint-montreal-python-packagi/">supporting the sprint</a> by covering the cost of food
and drinks. Fuel (food and drinks), is not a requirement for a sprint
since dedicated hackers will show up whether they have to bring their
own booze or not, but it's nice to be able to reward sprinters with a
savory meal. They deserve it. The <a href="http://pythonsprints.com/">sprint sponsorship program</a> is a
great thing, not because there is a financial bottleneck to organizing
sprint, but because having a common coordinator for Python sprint will
help to share the excitement and the knowledge of what works for sprints
and what doesn't. Hopefully, other user groups will join us and make
sprints a core element of their schedule. [gallery]</p>
