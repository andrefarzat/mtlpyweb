Right after PyCon (victory!), I went to Seoul. Before leaving, I figured
"Hey, they may have a Seoul-Python or something!", so I looked around,
and found a forum: [python.kr][].

I posted a message there introducing myself and asking if anyone wanted
to meet to discuss our favorite language. I got a few responses, and I
met 7 of them a few days ago.

What surprised me at first was how similar to our community they all
were: they enjoy beer, and more than half of them were in startups, one
similar to groupon, and the other one is kind of a mix between
foursquare and kik.

One of the first things I asked was if they had regular meetings, much
like we do, and I was surprised that they didn't. They explained that in
2006, everyone wanted to do Python, so they held a conference in Seoul
that ended up attracting over 1500 programmers! They continued to
explain that Python was now the mainstream language, it is even taught
in their universities.

They concluded by saying that a community like ours was no longer
necessary, but a FAQ forum like they have now was more than enough.

I think we have a lot to do to reach that point, but it certainly gave
me hope!
