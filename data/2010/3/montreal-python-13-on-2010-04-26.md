<!--:en-->Montréal-Python 13 will take place at UQAM, on Monday
2010-04-26 in room SH-3420 of the Sherbrooke building. The SH building
is located at [200 Sherbrooke west][], Place-des-Arts metro station.
Here is our schedule for the evening:

-   18h00: Opening
-   18h20: Announcements
-   18h30: Flash presentations
-   19h00: Break
-   19h20: Main presentation
-   20h30: Discussions and refreshments at Benelux

Flash Presenters will be:

-   Hao Deng on Pointfree Functional Programming in Python
-   Pierre Thibault on ipython
-   Alexandre Bourget on WebUndo
-   Sébastien Pierre on a surprise topic
-   Yannick Gingras on the Montréal-Python wiki

Our main presenter is going to be *Andrew Francis* and he’s going to
talk about *Implementing Go's select in Stackless Python*.

> Google's introduction of the Go language raised eyebrows in the
> Stackless Python community. Although very different languages, Go and
> Stackless Python's concurrency model share a common ancestor: the Bell
> Labs family of languages (i.e., Newsqueak, Limbo). The common feature
> are channels: a synchronous message passing mechanism based on Tony
> Hoare's Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP).

> Both Go and Python have channels. However with the select language
> statement. Go has the ability to wait on multiple channels
> simultaneously. Stackless Python does not have this feature.

> This talk discusses implementing a Select like feature in Stackless
> Python. The technique will be to prototype the feature with
> stackless.py - the PyPy's project implementation of Stackless Python
> written in Python!

> Along the way, audience will learn Stackless Python basics and get a
> glimpse at greenlets and PyPy. In the process, the audience will see
> how Stackless Python's API reflects philosophical differences between
> Go and Stackless Python's approach to concurrency.

> Living in Montréal, Andrew Francis has an academic background in the
> humanities, computer science, and management. Professionally, Andrew
> has worked at companies such as BNR, Omnimark, and Adobe Systems in
> California. Ever since 2005, Andrew has been playing with Stackless
> Python, as a part of his work with WS-BPEL, and he has never looked
> back! At Pycon 2008, Andrew gave the talk “Adventures in Stackless
> Python/Twisted Integration.”
