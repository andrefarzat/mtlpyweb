<!--:en-->Thanks to everyone who took part in the latest translation
sprint of the Django technical documentation of Django on March 31 at
[Brasseurs Numériques][]' office. We were seven motivated Pythonistas
and we progressed very quickly in this endeavour. More than that,
numerous contacts have been made with the French Django community
(Django-fr).  We now try to coordinate a little bit more with them
because with the release of Django-1.2 we'll need to keep up the good
work, ideally with more and more people.  So far, we've completed the
translation 12 files from the documentation. Another sprint will be
organized in the following weeks in the hope that we gather more people
and to have fun with this work. Thanks to the [Brasseurs Numériques][]
for their good hospitality. Thanks to the [Agence universitaire de la
Francophonie][] for the food and the drinks. Congratulation to our
sprinters:

-   Davin Baragiotta
-   Cyril Robert
-   François Savard
-   Antoine Reversat
-   Yannick Gingras
-   Mathieu Leduc-Hamel
-   Jean Schurger
