<p>If you listen to mainstream media and notorious market analysts, you are
lead to believe that simply using Python is enough to make you deliver
code ten times faster.</p>
</p>

<p>Obviously, this simplistic view of the world fails to take into account
the <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/environment/story/2012-01-30/pythons-florida-everglades/52893342/1">constant battle</a> with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in the
Everglades but most of all, it fails to take into account that the
Python language itself is a very small contribution compared to the
tools and the body of knowledge shared within the community.</p>
</p>

<p>Of course, we all understand that development is more than just writing
code. On June 12th, Montréal-Python is going to celebrate our unwritten
lore with Nootropic Nutrients, a meeting on the Best Practices and tools
in the Python world.</p>
</p>

<p>Can you claim a ten-fold speedup compared to developement with
traditional languages? Do you have hard-won secrets that you would like
to share? Come and tell us about your tools and stategies for
efficiently and consistently delivering your projects on time.</p>
</p>

<p>We are looking for speakers for presentations ranging from 5 minutes to
40 minutes. If you are interested, send us an email to
<a href="mailto:mtlpyteam@googlegroups.com">mtlpyteam@googlegroups.com</a> with a short description of your talk.</p>
</p>

<p>The meeting will follow the usual schedule, starting around 6:30pm and
moving to the pub for the follow-up discussions around 8:30pm.</p>
