<!--:en-->The django translation sprint was a clear success. A team of
eight sprinters worked on the Django documentation and after an intense
training session on the toolchain, we were able complete a sizable part
of the API documentation. Our coach, Mathieu Leduc-Hamel, did a great
job pinpointing the relevent documents and supporting the team during
our moments of struggle with Mercurial and Sphinx. This is definitely an
adventure that we want to revisit. We estimate that with three or four
additional sittings, we would be able to reach the complete translation
of the documentation. Thanks to Brasseurs Num√©riques for hosting the
event and Congratulations to the sprint team:
