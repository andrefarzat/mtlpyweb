<p>Montréal-Python 13 will take place at UQAM, on Monday
2010-04-26 in room SH-3420 of the Sherbrooke building. The SH building
is located at <a href="http://www.uqam.ca/campus/pavillons/sh.htm">200 Sherbrooke west</a>, Place-des-Arts metro station.</p>
<p>Here is our schedule for the evening:</p>
<ul>
<li>18h00: Opening</li>
<li>18h20: Announcements</li>
<li>18h30: Flash presentations</li>
<li>19h00: Break</li>
<li>19h20: Main presentation</li>
<li>20h30: Discussions and refreshments at Benelux</li>
</ul>
<p>Flash Presenters will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hao Deng on Pointfree Functional Programming in Python</li>
<li>Pierre Thibault on ipython</li>
<li>Alexandre Bourget on WebUndo</li>
<li>Sébastien Pierre on a surprise topic</li>
<li>Yannick Gingras on the Montréal-Python wiki</li>
</ul>
<p>Our main presenter is going to be <em>Andrew Francis</em> and he’s going to
talk about <em>Implementing Go's select in Stackless Python</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Google's introduction of the Go language raised eyebrows in the
Stackless Python community. Although very different languages, Go and
Stackless Python's concurrency model share a common ancestor: the Bell
Labs family of languages (i.e., Newsqueak, Limbo). The common feature
are channels: a synchronous message passing mechanism based on Tony
Hoare's Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP).</p>
<p>Both Go and Python have channels. However with the select language
statement. Go has the ability to wait on multiple channels
simultaneously. Stackless Python does not have this feature.</p>
<p>This talk discusses implementing a Select like feature in Stackless
Python. The technique will be to prototype the feature with
stackless.py - the PyPy's project implementation of Stackless Python
written in Python!</p>
<p>Along the way, audience will learn Stackless Python basics and get a
glimpse at greenlets and PyPy. In the process, the audience will see
how Stackless Python's API reflects philosophical differences between
Go and Stackless Python's approach to concurrency.</p>
<p>Living in Montréal, Andrew Francis has an academic background in the
humanities, computer science, and management. Professionally, Andrew
has worked at companies such as BNR, Omnimark, and Adobe Systems in
California. Ever since 2005, Andrew has been playing with Stackless
Python, as a part of his work with WS-BPEL, and he has never looked
back! At Pycon 2008, Andrew gave the talk “Adventures in Stackless
Python/Twisted Integration.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We still have a few spots for flash presentations so don’t hesitate to
contact us if you have something that you would like to present.</p>
