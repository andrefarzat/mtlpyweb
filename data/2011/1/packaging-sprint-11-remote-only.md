Due to the very low rate of registration, we won't hold the [sprint
tomorrow][] at Le Site. The sprint will be remote only; you can still
meet us on irc.freenode.net, in \#montrealpython and in \#distutils.

We take note that sprinting during the weekend is not a good option for
most of you. Expect some new sprints on weekday evenings in the coming
weeks.
