<!--:en-->The third packaging sprint was a clear success: we closed
tickets, seven sprinters showed up, and everyone got to commit
something. Congratulation to all the sprinters:

-   Pior Bartida
-   Nicolas Cadou
-   Yannick Gingras
-   Mathieu Leduc-Hamel
-   George Peristerakis
-   Cyril Robert
-   Tarek Ziadé (remote)

We were also lucky to have Tarek Ziadé in voice conference from the
other side of the Atlantic, which really jump-started our motivation.
Tarek gave us an overview of the state of the packaging, he did put the
various tickets in a wider context, and gave some orientation to our
strategy. Over all, it was a very good sprint with work that got done
on:

-   Distutils2, the next generation of distutils
-   Distribute, the temporary replacement for setuptools
-   PyPI, the website that aggregates Python packages

The motivation is high and we keep going with our momentum. Therefore,
without waiting any longer, we already launch the next sprint. It will
be on 2010-06-02 starting at 6 pm. Stay tuned to know the location.
