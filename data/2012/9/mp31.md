With a bang, Montréal-Python is coming back to you after the summer
break with the loudest MP meeting to date.

Join us on the 17th of September for Montréal-Python 31, Orchestral
Onomatopoeia, our first cannon shot of the 2012-2013 season. Come join
us at 6pm at Concordia University for topics ranging from build tools to
special effect work.

Our main speaker: **Greg Ward**

*The Problem With Build Tools, or, why the heck are people still using
Make in 2012?*

Contrary to the expectations of language partisans, most programmers
expect to bounce from one programming language to another, and expect
their tools to support that sort of mobility. So I've started working on
a new build tool that will be extensible in whatever language they
choose -- including Python, of course. My goal is fast and simple like
Make, but powerful and extensible like SCons or Gradle.

The remaining lineup:

-   **Sylvain Berger**: Python goes Hollywood ([Modus FX][])
-   **Miquel Campos**: Python, Softimage and 3d Pipeline
    ([Shedmtl.com][])
-   **Rory Geoghegan**: Module of the Month: dateutil
-   **Philippe Gauvin**: Comment développer une communauté par de
    meilleurs emplois ([MatchFWD][])
-   **Francis Piéraut**: [QMining][] startup empowered by appengine &
    amazon pros & cons preview
