<!--:en-->**update:** Thanks to our generous sponsors Iweb and Microsost
Canada, the event is now free of charge. PHP-Québec, Montréal-Python,
Ruby Montréal, W3Qc, and OWASP Montréal are glad to invite you to
[ConFooBBQ][], the BBQ for developers. Inspired by PHP-Québec's
legendary PHP-BBQ, ConFooBBQ offers a unique opportunity to relax and
enlarge your network of developers and other actors of the various web
development communities in Montréal. In addition to the traditional
hot-dogs, ConFooBBQ will feature the first edition of ConFooBrew, a home
brewing contest for geeks! Each user group has the opportunity to elect
a master brewer who will represent them with a batch of homebrew beer.
Come and taste geek brews such as Hopecode Cache and Pythoune Blanche.
ConFooBBQ will take place in Mont Royal Park, near Smith House on Sunday
September 13th at 1h00 pm. ConFooBBQ is a family event; spouses and
children are all welcome. The cost for the food will be $0. On the
menu: hot-dogs, chips, salad, soft drinks, cookies, and lots of fun.

contest. If you cannot find the location, feel free to call Yann
