Hi **Montréal-Python** Users!

The **PyCon organizers** are happy to announce that ticket sales for the
March 2013 conference have opened at
[https://us.pycon.org/2013/registration/][] ! Early bird rates are
available for the first 1000 purchases, which is a departure from
previous time-based systems. With **PyCon 2012** having been a quick
sell out, we're expecting this one to be the same. Keep in mind that
attendance is strictly limited to **2500**.

**PyCon 2013** is going back to Santa Clara, CA before heading up north
for two years in **Montreal, Quebec for 2014-15**. The event starts with
two days of tutorials on March 13, followed by three days of talks
starting March 15, and ends with four days of sprints starting March 18.

Individual and corporate ticket prices remain the same as they have been
for the last few years, with early bird rates of $300 and $450
respectively. The regular rates of $350 and $600 for individual and
corporate are still an incredible deal.

For 2013 we've reduced the cost to students by 50%, bringing the early
bird rate to $100 with a regular rate of $125. Providing a more
affordable conference experience for students is a priority for the
organizers and the *Python Software Foundation*, and we're hoping the
decrease helps bring more of them out.

We've also increased our financial aid program, and hope to assist more
attendees for **PyCon 2013**! You can apply for financial aid through
the [new consolidated form][]

We're still accepting proposals for talks and tutorials, with a deadline
of September 28. Poster proposals are accepted through January 15, 2013.
