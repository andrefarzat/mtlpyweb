MontrealPython3 was a lot of fun. Martin Blais gave us 2 very
interesting presentations. In case you missed it or want to follow up,
you can find snakefood, beancount and more at
`http://furius.ca/home/software.html`_.

Thanks again to StandoutJobs for lending us their space and Akoha for
the refreshments.

MontrealPython4 will be July 31st. We'll have more details in the weeks
to come.
