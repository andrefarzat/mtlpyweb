We are pleased to announce that Montreal Python 6 will be on 2009-04-14
at [La Banque][].

</p>

Our main presenter will be [Francis Piéraut][] on Machine Learning
empowered by Python:

>
> Machine Learning is a subfield of AI that considers learning patterns
> from existing data. Related applications are increasing in many fields
> where adaptive systems are needed, like fraud detection, face
> recognition, recommendation systems, disambiguation systems, insurance
> risk estimation, web traffic filtering, voice recognition, and many
> others.
>
> </p>
>
> The first part of this presentation will cover the basics of machine
> learning; in the second part, we will dive into a real example and see
> the complete process of using machine learning to create a real-time
> digit recognition system using [Mlboost][], a python library. The
> practical approach should allow the audience to assimilate the most
> important concepts of machine learning and the critical need for data
> preprocessing.
>
> </p>
>
> After a Software Engineer degree, Francis Piéraut made a research
> master in Machine Learning at [LISA][]. During his research work, he
> developed flayers, a powerful C++ neural network library. During the
> beginning of his career, his spend several years in Montreal startups
> companies applying Machine Learning and statistical AI related
> solutions. In 2005, he released the first version of MLboost, a python
> library that allows him to speedup his Machine Learning projects by
> simplifying data preprocessing, features selection and data
> visualization.
