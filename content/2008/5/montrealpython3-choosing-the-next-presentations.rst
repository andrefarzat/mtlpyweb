I really like the use of the mailing list as a way to pitch presentation
ideas, it's efficient and open. The downside is that a mailing list is
not great for individual feedback because nobody wants to disturb more
than 30 people with their preference. So here is a little experiment to
help us organize in a more simple and open way: a polling widget.

For more information on the presentations listed below, look `here for
Hugo Boyer's`_ and `here for Martin Blais' presentation ideas`_ .

There are other people who have suggested presentation topics they would
like to present, I invite them (you) to write to the list, it's the way
to get a talk on MontrealPython. If you're not on the mailing list,
please join `http://groups.google.com/group/montrealpython`_

MontrealPython3 date coming soon ...
