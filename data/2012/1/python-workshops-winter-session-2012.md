<!--:en-->You're dreaming to feel Python leather on your keyboard? You
already know its legendary softness and now want to feel the gentle
power of its grasp? Pythonista in the egg, moulting or already moving :
the Winter 2012 series of Python workshops has arrived! This semester,
Montréal-Python is offering one workshop a month :

-   January : Introduction Workshop to Python
-   February : Python Workshop : more advanced notions and use of
    Twitter API
-   March : Django Workshop : building a Python web app
-   April : Advanced Workshop : integration of libraries and a guest
    star!

The content of these workshops has been forged collaboratively by
professional trainers, practionners and academics from the community.
Animated by our champions, they are offered in French at UQAM and
English at McGill. **They're open to all** : only minimal knowledge of
programming is required (e.g.: to know what a variable is). You also
need to bring a laptop to follow the exercises. These workshops are
independent : to attend one, no need to attend the formers. But to
progress on the Pythonic Way, to follow them all is better than
following one. When to start? "Now is better than never." -- [Zen of
