<!--:en-->The [fourth Django translation sprint][] was very productive.
The group is now experienced and we can at last spend more time
strugling with the language than with the tools. Anyone knows a good
translation for "file handler"? We hope to launch a new sprint a few
weeks from now; watch the blog or the mailing list for the announcement.
Thanks to [AUF][] for the food and the drinks and thanks to [Brasseurs
Numériques][] for hosting the event. Congratulation to all the sprinters
for their good work:

-   Pior Bastida
-   Thibault Cohen
-   Yannick Gingras
-   Benoît Grégoire
-   François Lapierre-Messier
-   Mathieu Leduc-Hamel
-   Jonathan Marcil
-   Cyril Robert
-   Jean Schurger
