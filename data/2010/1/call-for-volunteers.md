growth of a strong community of Pythonistas in Montréal. Among other
things, we have the regular meetings, the editing and publishing of
videos, the ConFoo conference, and recently, the organization of
sprints. In order to better manager these activities and to launch new
ones, the Montréal-Python team is looking for new organizers. A good
organizer is probably someone who uses Python frequently but most of
all, it's someone who can communicate effectively in both French and
English. If your are interested by the challenge, let us know swiftly
