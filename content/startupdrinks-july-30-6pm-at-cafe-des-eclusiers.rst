Heri and our friends from MontrealTechWatch are organizing
Montreal.StartupDrinks this Wednesday (July 30). I thought since
MontrealPython4 is postponed, some of you would enjoy joining this event
which is different but related.

The concept is simple:

    startup culture in cities around the world gathers around a bar to
    have a pint and discuss what they are working on, what they need
    help with and what they can do for each other.

In previous events, there were a great mix of entrepreneurs, developers,
business & technology consultants, CEOs and CTOs of software companies
in Montreal. This time, it will be held at Café des Éclusiers: `400 rue
de la Commune Ouest`_. For those who don't know, it's in the Old
Montreal and the place is beautiful. See you.
