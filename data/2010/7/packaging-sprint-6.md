The last sprint was [a productive one][], yet we left with a few
outstanding issues. In order to correct those while everything is still
fresh in our mind, we don't waste anytime and go for another sprint on
the Python packaging system this Thursday, 2010-07-15.

The sprint will be at [Brasseurs Numériques][], 1124 Marie-Anne, suite
11, starting at 6h30 pm and going as long as there are hackers standing.

Bring your own laptop or make an arrangement for pairing on the mailing
list beforehand. Attendance is limited to 12 persons so please [RSVP on
the wiki][].
