Grig Gheorghiu  from SoCal piggies says:

> We had the SoCal Piggies meeting at the Disney Animation Studios last
> night. It was a great meeting -- great presentations from Disney
> engineers on how they use Python at Disney (and they use it A LOT!),
> great food, great turnout, and great atmosphere. Let me tell you --
> the Disney Animation Studios are \*lush\*. Thanks to Paul Hildebrandt
> for organizing the meeting. I'll probably blog separately about the
> technical content of the presentations, but for now I just wanted to
> comment on the fact that everybody seems to be hiring Python
> programmers -- [Gorilla Nation][] and [Virgin Charter][] are just two
> companies in the L.A. area that are aggressively looking to hire
> Python talent. Another thing: we used to have difficulties in finding
> venues for our meetings. We used to meet at either USC or Caltech, and
> around 10-12 people max. would show up. Now companies are clamoring
> for organizing the meetings at their offices, and we have 20-30 people
> in the audience, with many new faces at every meeting. Even more: Ruby
> on Rails programmers are showing up at our meetings, looking for an
> opportunity to be more involved with Python! I take that as a sign
> that Python has arrived. It's a good time to be a Python programmer
