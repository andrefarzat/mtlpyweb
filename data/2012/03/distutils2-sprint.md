<!--:en-->Pythonistas, Distutils2 is looking for love, and you are the
group who are going to give it! The Montreal-Python user group is
hosting, on the 21st of April, a sprint in Montreal to work
on Distutils2 with Éric Araujo, Python core developer and distutils2
maintainer. Bring your laptop and your magic fingers, and we will
provide the food and the good times. No previous knowledge of Distutils2
required, just general Python skills. Distutils2 is the official
successor of distutils. It aims to be a better, more flexible and more
featureful packaging tool for Python authors, as well as a reusable
library for packaging tools developers. Distutils2 is included in the
Python 3.3 standard library under the name “packaging”, the module named
“distutils2” is the standalone backport for Python versions 2.5 to 2.7,
and 3.x. The first beta versions of Python 3.3 and Distutils2 are coming
in June, and we are planning a series of sprints to make it ready for
the release. A sprint is simply programmers meeting together
face-to-face to work on the same project. Previous sprints held in
Montreal have improved Distutils2, why don’t you come along for the next
one and put your mark on a Python release? The good folks at
Radialpoint have graciously provided us with space and free pizza. Come
join us on Saturday, the 21st of April, from 12pm to 7pm. The address
is: [2050 Bleury Street Suite 300][] Registration [here][] is preferable
but not required. For hacks and glory!
