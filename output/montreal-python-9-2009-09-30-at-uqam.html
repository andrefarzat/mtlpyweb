<p><strong>update:</strong>the event was moved from the 23rd to the 30th.</p>
<p>Montréal-Python 9 will take place at UQAM, on Wednesday 2009-09-30 in
room PK-5115 of the President-Kenedy building. The PK building is
located at <a href="http://www.uqam.ca/campus/pavillons/pk.htm">201 Président-Kenedy</a>, the street that is also called
Ontario on the east side of St-Laurent. The PK building has a direct
entrance to the Place-des-Arts metro station.</p>
<p>Here is our schedule for the evening:</p>
<ul>
<li>18h00: Opening</li>
<li>18h20: Announcements</li>
<li>18h30: Flash presentations</li>
<li>19h00: Break</li>
<li>19h20: Main presentation</li>
</ul>
<p>Our main presenter will be Andrew Francis and he is going to walk us
through his Survey of Stackless Python:</p>
<blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>
Over the years, Stackless Python has acquired a mystical reputation,
mostly based around its micro-thread implement and its use in a really
big MOORPG. Otherwise, relatively little is known about Stackless
Python. I would like to change this...</p>
<p></p>
<p>
In this talk, I will discuss what is Stackless Python and its
relationship to Python. I will give an overview of key Stackless
Python concepts. Special attention will be devoted to network
programming. I will finish the talk with a mention of my own Stackless
work and Stackless Python's future. Throughout the talk, I will
suggest that Stackless Python true strength is not the performance of
its concurrency model but rather its simplicity that gives insights as
to what a Pythonic concurrency model would look like.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Living in Montreal, Andrew Francis has an academic background in the
humanities, computer science, and management. Professionally, Andrew has
worked at companies such as BNR, Omnimark, and Adobe Systems in
California. Ever since 2005, Andrew has been playing with Stackless
Python, as a part of his work with WS-BPEL, and he has never looked
back! At Pycon 2008, Andrew gave the talk "Adventures in Stackless
Python/Twisted Integration."</p>
<p></p>
We still have a lot of open slots for flash presentations so don't
hesitate to propose a talk. Also, our speaker pool is running low so
please get in touch with us if you have an idea for a main presentation.</p>
