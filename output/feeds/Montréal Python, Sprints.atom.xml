&lt;p&gt;This Saturday, you have the opportunity of participating in the Python
Bug Day. How would you like to be one of the contributors of Python? If
you have ideas for improving parts of the official documentation, the
standard library, the language itself, or if you have a patch waiting
for a review that you would like to see committed, or if you just want
to come and fix an existing bug, it's your day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join us for an effort at closing some Python bugs and feature requests.
Get quick feedback on your patches and bugfixes, learn how to submit and
examine patches, and have fun chatting with the Python developers and
other contributors. You don’t need to know the CPython codebase or
process to join, just Python programming knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you live in Montreal, come at Caravan to meet fellow hackers and take
part in a physical sprint! The address is 5334 de Gaspé; we'll be there
from 10:00 to 18:00.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please register at &lt;a href="http://mpbugday.eventbrite.ca/"&gt;http://mpbugday.eventbrite.ca/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to let us know
how many people to expect. People from around the world are welcome to
join the #python-dev IRC channel to participate in the bug day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This page contains all the information you need to get set up, see the
list of bugs or learn about IRC:

beforehand, feel free to ask on &lt;a href="http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/core-mentorship"&gt;core-mentorship mailing-list&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href="http://caravan.coop/"&gt;Caravan&lt;/a&gt; for sponsoring us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Volunteering through technology</title><link href="http://localhost:8888/en/2011/11/13/volunteering-through-technology/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-11-13T21:06:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Dimitry Zolotaryov (dim.zol@gmail.com)</name></author><id>tag:localhost:8888,2011-11-13:en/2011/11/13/volunteering-through-technology/</id><summary type="html">&lt;!--:en--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does a developer change the world? One function at a time.
This December the Notman House gives you a chance to join likeminded
others and hack for a greater good. The event is Random Hacks of
Kindness and it will be hosted this December 3rd and 4th. On the first
day, Montreal participants will be presented real-life problems by
representatives of Médecins Sans Frontières and the LIRNEasia think
tank. Once a problem chosen, your team will then have two days to create
a solution. In this feat you will not be alone. Thousands of people
world wide will be participating in &lt;a href="http://www.rhok.org/events"&gt;30 sister events&lt;/a&gt; along with you.
Participants in other cities will work on solutions to the problems of
their community or their organization. Here in Montreal, I (Dimitry
Zolotaryov) am looking for team-mates to represent Montreal-Python.
Developers, designers, engineers and social media people are all
welcome. Send me a message if you're interested in being part of an
enthusiastic team: dimitry@webit.ca. This is your chance to hack for
good. Won't you accept the challenge? Register Here:

&lt;p&gt;During the last packaging sprint, we were kind of clueless.
&lt;a href="http://tarekziade.wordpress.com/"&gt;Tarek Ziade&lt;/a&gt; is coming to the rescue, and will be coaching us live
from Dijon, France. Thanks to his support and the many questions you
will be able to ask him, we hope we can bring some real improvements to
Python packaging (distutils2, distribute, and PyPi). That way we'll be
able to make a real contribution to the community, and bring the future
of Python packaging closer. We recommend everyone to read carefully &lt;a href="http://guide.python-distribute.org/"&gt;The
Hitchhiker’s Guide to Packaging&lt;/a&gt; and to ask any questions you may have
on the mailing list before Saturday. Next saturday (2010-05-22), from
2pm to 1am, we will be holding the next packaging sprint, at Brasseurs
Numeriques (1124 Marie-Anne, bur. 11). Every Python programmer looking
to help is welcome, whether it is to help on code or documentation.
Bring your laptop or make a pairing arrangement on the mailing list
beforehand. We have a capacity of 12 seats, please RSVP on the &lt;a href="http://wiki.montrealpython.org/index.php/Packaging_no.3"&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt;.
We don't have any sponsors for this sprint, but this won't stop us.
Bring your refreshments, and we will place a group order for supper
around 7pm.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>
