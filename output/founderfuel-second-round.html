<p>Let me tell you a story… Two years ago, I embarked on this great
adventure starting <a href="http://ajah.ca">a company</a>, raising high my Python sword and
slashing all the challenges that I would face during my journey.</p>
</p>

<p>This feeling that warms you up when someone finds your code so useful
that they will pay money for it is amazing.</p>
</p>

<p>Starting a company is much more than that though; it’s the opportunity
to talk to people and to use your empathy to figure out what they really
want; it’s the opportunity to decide all by yourself what kind of crazy
new software development methodologies you’re going to use; it’s the
opportunity to write code that is 100% tested — or not waste anytime on
those stinking tests that only slow you down; it’s the opportunity to
take the the phone and to learn the hard way how to close a sale (a
skill that will serve you well for years to come in many aspects of your
life, from negotiating a business deal to dating).</p>
</p>

<p>Starting a company is stressful, yes, but it’s a lot of fun. <a href="http://founderfuel.com/en/">Founder
Fuel</a> is an exciting local initiative that gives an average of \$20k
to new startups and helps them grow by nurturing them with skilled
mentoring and a very influential network of contacts.</p>
</p>

<p>In the four months of the program, the companies are are expected to
grow from essentially nothing into usable and marketable products.</p>
</p>

<p>The first round of startups presented their products last Tuesday during
the demo day, and it was very exciting to see how far many of those went
during such a short time.</p>
</p>

<p>The second round is <a href="http://founderfuel.com/en/schedule/">now open</a> to applications, and you have until
January 7th to <a href="http://founderfuel.com/en/apply/">submityour startup idea</a>. In the first round, not a
single startup had a strong Python presence.</p>
</p>

<p>Will we see more Python companies this time?</p>
</p>

<p>Let’s try to make it happen!</p>
