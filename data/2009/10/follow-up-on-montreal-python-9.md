<!--:en-->Here is a follow-up on Montréal Python 9. First, the video was
uploaded to our [blip.tv channel][]. It's currently queued for
transcoding and should show up in the coming days. Based on your
feedback, we continue posting the slides and examples used during the
presentations. Our flash presenters were:

-   Simon Law: [Cygwinreg][] and ctypes -- Using the Windows registry
    from Cygwin ([slides][])
-   Mathieu Chartier: [ConFoo.ca][] -- One of the largest Web
    development conference in North-America
-   Sébastien Pierre: Sink -- A tool to compare and keep directories in
    sync ([slides][1])
-   Erik Wright: Django Lean -- A tool for lean development and A/B
    testing ([slides][2])
-   Alexandre Vassalotti: Memory profiling for Python programs
    ([slides][3], [example][])
-   Hugo Boyer: PyCUDA -- High performance computation using graphic
    cards ([slides and examples][])

Our main presenter was *Andrew Francis* on *Stackless Python*
([slides][4]). Montréal-Python is a co-organizer of the [ConFoo.ca][]
conference and we'd like remind you that there is little less than four
weeks to submit a talk proposal. Also, there will be a BarCamp with a
presentation on AppEngine at [Station C][] on 2009-10-29. It would be a
good occasion to have a small informall Python gathering. Finally, we
would like to thank our sponsors for Montréal Python 9:

-   gold: [Département d'Informatique de l'UQAM][]
-   bronze: [O'Reilly][] and [AESS][]
