&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="magicdomid10"&gt;
The workshop will be held at Concordia's **EV building room 2.184 at
6:00pm**.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="magicdomid11"&gt;
The address is **1515 St. Catherine W**.

&lt;div id="magicdomid17"&gt;
To learn more about the technical setup, you can visit the Workshop page
:[http://montrealpython.org/r/projects/workshops/wiki/2012-10-30][]. If
you need help setting up, we will be in the room 30 minutes before the
workshop to help you set up your environment with everything you need to

&lt;p&gt;Montréal-Python and UQAM's Association générale des étudiants
et étudiantes en informatique  (AGEEI, the student union of CS students)
are proud to announce their very first French open attendance Python
workshop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You do not need to know any Python since this is going to be
an Introduction to Python session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our MC for the evening is going to be Davin Baragiotta, vice-president
of Montréal-Python and coordonator of information systems at
Agence Universitaire de la Francophonie (AUF).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event is going to feature two parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first part is going to bring us up to speed with the syntax,
    core data types, main modules of the standard library, and the
    intractive shell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the second part Davin will dive deep with a practical application
    of Python: building a Jabber bot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The workshop is going to take place in room SH-R810 of the Shebrooke
building of UQAM on November 17 from 6h30 PM to 9h PM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
AGEEI will provide pizza and refreshments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you to our sponsors &lt;a href="http://ludia.com"&gt;Ludia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://savoirfairelinux.com"&gt;Savoir-faire Linux&lt;/a&gt; to help
us creating this event!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All you have to bring is your curious brain, your sense of humour, and
your laptop computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have some spare time, you can also get your system ready by
installing Python 2.7 from the following
site: &lt;a href="http://www.python.org/download/"&gt;http://www.python.org/download/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ubuntu users are lucky here because all what they have to do is: &lt;em&gt;sudo
apt-get install python (if it's not installed already).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If  you don't have time to do the setup of if get lost,  DON'T PANIC. 
We'll be there starting at 5h30 PM, and we'll help you get everything up
and running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To register, you simply have to sign up for free on the
guestlist: &lt;a href="http://guestli.st/76584"&gt;http://guestli.st/76584&lt;/a&gt;&lt;!--:--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Venue for Introduction Class</title><link href="http://montrealpython.org/intro-class-venue.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-04-20T21:55:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Jszkut</name></author><id>tag:montrealpython.org,2011-04-20:intro-class-venue.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;!--:en--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The response has been amazing so far for the &lt;a href="http://montrealpython.org/2011/03/intro-class/"&gt;Introduction to
Programming with Python class&lt;/a&gt; we announced earlier this month. So
amazing, in fact, that we had to temporarily close off registration
while we booked a new venue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good news, though, registration has been re-opened, and those of you who
were on the waiting list have now been put on the guestlist. We have
also chosen a location — room &lt;strong&gt;SH-2420&lt;/strong&gt; of the &lt;a href="http://www.uqam.ca/campus/pavillons/sh.htm"&gt;Sherbrooke pavilion&lt;/a&gt;
at UQAM. Wi-fi will be provided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to seeing you all there!&lt;!--:--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>McGill Python Workshop</title><link href="http://montrealpython.org/mcgill-python-workshop.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-03-27T23:02:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Mperrault</name></author><id>tag:montrealpython.org,2011-03-27:mcgill-python-workshop.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;!--:en--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&lt;img alt="McGill Python Workshop" src="http://montrealpython.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/McGillPythonWorkshop-300x186.jpg" title="McGill Python Workshop" /&gt;][]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday March 23rd was held the first of what is sure to be a
series of Python workshops held at McGill University. Organized by
Professor Derek Ruths and I of Ruths Research
(&lt;a href="http://ruthsresearch.org"&gt;http://ruthsresearch.org&lt;/a&gt;), the workshop attracted more than 80
attendees, most of them students from McGill University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this first Python workshop was to introduce attendees to
the simplicity of working with the language. Professor Ruths started the
session by talking about some of the reasons people are choosing Python
over other languages: easiness in learning the language, the amazing
power it has under the hood and the speed with which one can go from
idea to prototype. He then introduced the containers that are built in
to the language (list, dict, set, tuple) and presented ways that code
can be made simpler and more readable using standard methods on these
containers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then built, in front of the audience, an application that interfaced
with the Twitter API. This allowed me to introduce great modules that
are offered with Python: urllib and json. Attendees were guided through
the steps of working with an API (from reading the documentation to
making a GET request) and shown how simple it is to get from an idea to
a working Python program in less than 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall the organizers were quite pleased with the event and plan to
organize more of them in the future. Materials from this last event can
be found on their website (&lt;a href="http://ruthsresearch.org/mpw"&gt;http://ruthsresearch.org/mpw&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;!--:--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
