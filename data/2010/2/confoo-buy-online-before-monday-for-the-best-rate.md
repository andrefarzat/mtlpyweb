<!--:en-->Sunday is officially the last day to register for ConFoo at
the current price. Actually, that not quite exact because as a way to
thank you for reading this blog, we offer you $100 of rebate. Simply
follow this link to register at the community rate:
[http://confoo.ca/pymontreal][] You probably recall that Chris Perkins
is giving a one-day training session on [Web development with Python and
Turbogears][]. You get an additional $100 of rebate if you attend to
both the training and the conference. Having seen Chris in the tutorials
at PyCon, I can't put enough emphasis on how good a teacher he is. This
is a very unique opportunity to get high quality training on Web
development with Python right here in Montr√©al.
