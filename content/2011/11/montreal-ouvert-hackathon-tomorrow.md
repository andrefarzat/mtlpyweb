At our last meeting, we came up with 3 different projects. Feel free to
join us on these projects or to start your own one. In the mean time,
here is a brief description of what we would like to do:

</p>

**Air and Water Quality**

</p>

Create an automated twitter feed that will publish alerts on bad
environmental conditions on the island of Montreal in real-time by
monitoring air and water quality information published by the city.

</p>

**Montréal Photos 2.0**

</p>

Improve Montrealphotos.org with semantics information by crowd sourcing.
Those information include more accurate geotags and datetags, links to
relevant websites (wikipedia?) and tags. And then make it social!

</p>

**Recreation Montreal**

</p>

Centralized all the informations about the different recreation activies
available in Montreal and then, allowing the citizens to enjoy their
pools, their ski trails and all what they need to have fun in their city
in a pythonic way.

</p>

*For Hacks and glory*
