		</h1>
		<p>As you hopefully know by now, Montreal Python 6 is this Tuesday at <a href="http://labanque.ca/">la
Banque</a>. Here is our schedule for the evening:</p>
<ul>
<li>18h00: Opening</li>
<li>18h45: Announcements and flash presentations</li>
<li>19h15: Break</li>
<li>19h45: Main presentation: Francis Piéraut on Machine Learning
    empowered by Python</li>
</ul>
<p>Flash presenters will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nathanaël Lécaudé: PyMT: module for developing multi-touch enabled
    applications</li>
<li>Stéphane Jolicoeur How Python is used at the National Film Board of
    Canada</li>
<li>Alexandre Bourget SFL Vault: a secure distributed crediential
    storage system</li>
<li>Herald Gjura The challenge of managing a horde of Pythonistas</li>
<li>François Pinard Tweeting with Python</li>
<li>Olivier Bélanger Ounk: a Python audio scripting environment for
    Csound; pitch for Montréal Python 7</li>
</ul>
<p>In case you missed the original announcement, here is the abstract for
the main presentation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Machine Learning is a subfield of AI that considers learning patterns
from existing data. Related applications are increasing in many fields
where adaptive systems are needed, like fraud detection, face
recognition, recommendation systems, disambiguation systems, insurance
risk estimation, web traffic filtering, voice recognition, and many
others.</p>
<p></p>
The first part of this presentation will cover the basics of machine
learning; in the second part, we will dive into a real example and see
the complete process of using machine learning to create a real-time
digit recognition system using Mlboost, a python library. The
practical approach should allow the audience to assimilate the most
important concepts of machine learning and the critical need for data
preprocessing.</p>
<p><p>
After a Software Engineer degree, Francis Piéraut made a research
master in Machine Learning at LISA. During his research work, he
developed flayers, a powerful C++ neural network library. During the
beginning of his career, his spend several years in Montreal startups
companies applying Machine Learning and statistical AI related
solutions. In 2005, he released the first version of MLboost, a python
library that allows him to speedup his Machine Learning projects by
simplifying data preprocessing, features selection and data
visualization.</p>

<p>See you there.</p>
