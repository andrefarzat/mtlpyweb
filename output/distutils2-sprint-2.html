<p>The first <a href="http://montrealpython.org/2012/03/distutils2-sprint/">Distutils2 sprint</a>, held on the 21st of April at
<a href="http://www.radialpoint.com/">RadialPoint's</a> office, was a real success.</p>
<p>That afternoon marked the renewal of Montréal-Python's contributions to
this vital project of the Python ecosystem. Indeed, two years ago,
sprints were organized here at the very beginning of Distutils2, which
aims to replace Distutils with a more powerful tool that implements the
new specs (PEPs) that all packaging tools will comply with in the long
term.</p>
<p>We're pleased that a dozen of volunteers were part of this first sprint!</p>
<p>I spent some time with every participant and I think everyone learnt
something from the sprint, be it knowledge on packaging, a first
experience in free software development or the writing test suites. I'd
like to thank everyone who came and opened Pandora's Box in order to fix
bugs for the benefit of the whole community.</p>
<p>The complexity of the code explains the fact that only two patches were
done at the end of the sprint, but the other patches started by the
other participants could certainly be completed during the next one.</p>
<p>In order to keep the pace, a second sprint will be held <em>Saturday the
12th of May</em>. <a href="http://www.tp1.ca/">TP1</a> will host this sprint and provide us with some
pizza. Keep in mind that our deadline is the release of the first beta
version on the 24th of June. We have until that point to close bugs and
implement some useful features still missing.</p>
<p><strong>Contributing to Distutils2 will help the whole Python community. Be
part of it!</strong></p>
<p>Second Distutils2 Sprint:</p>
<ul>
<li>Date: Saturday, 12th of May 2012, from 12:00 to 19:00</li>
<li>Place: TP1, 1410 Stanley street, office 500 (<a href="http://g.co/maps/c662j">map</a>)</li>
<li><a href="http://next-distutils2-sprint.eventbrite.ca/">Registration</a> is optional but recommended</li>
<li><a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/Distutils2/Sprints">Setup instructions</a> (can also be done on site)</li>
</ul>
