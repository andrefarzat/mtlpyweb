﻿The guys at Foulab just told us they were having a pretty cool workshop
on OpenCV (CV stands for Open Vision), and -you guessed it- the main
programming language will be Python! Here's their introduction: Do you
want to make your computer react to light, sound and gestures? Do you
want to capture and process images and video as part of your project? Do
you wonder: whats wrong with these lazy AI programmers, why cant my
computer recognize me yet? Get answers to all these questions and more
at the Foulab Workshop "Introduction to computer vision with OpenCV".
