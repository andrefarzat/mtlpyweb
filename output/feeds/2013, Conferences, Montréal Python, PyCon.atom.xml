&lt;p&gt;Hi &lt;strong&gt;Montréal-Python&lt;/strong&gt; Users!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;PyCon organizers&lt;/strong&gt; are happy to announce that ticket sales for the
March 2013 conference have opened at
&lt;a href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/registration/"&gt;https://us.pycon.org/2013/registration/&lt;/a&gt; ! Early bird rates are
available for the first 1000 purchases, which is a departure from
previous time-based systems. With &lt;strong&gt;PyCon 2012&lt;/strong&gt; having been a quick
sell out, we're expecting this one to be the same. Keep in mind that
attendance is strictly limited to &lt;strong&gt;2500&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PyCon 2013&lt;/strong&gt; is going back to Santa Clara, CA before heading up north
for two years in &lt;strong&gt;Montreal, Quebec for 2014-15&lt;/strong&gt;. The event starts with
two days of tutorials on March 13, followed by three days of talks
starting March 15, and ends with four days of sprints starting March 18.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individual and corporate ticket prices remain the same as they have been
for the last few years, with early bird rates of $300 and $450
respectively. The regular rates of $350 and $600 for individual and
corporate are still an incredible deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For 2013 we've reduced the cost to students by 50%, bringing the early
bird rate to $100 with a regular rate of $125. Providing a more
affordable conference experience for students is a priority for the
organizers and the &lt;em&gt;Python Software Foundation&lt;/em&gt;, and we're hoping the
decrease helps bring more of them out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've also increased our financial aid program, and hope to assist more
attendees for &lt;strong&gt;PyCon 2013&lt;/strong&gt;! You can apply for financial aid through
the &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?fromEmail=true&amp;amp;formkey=dGt4Z0dsY052VERJem4xUUFVQW9uQVE6MQ"&gt;new consolidated form&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're still accepting proposals for talks and tutorials, with a deadline
of September 28. Poster proposals are accepted through January 15, 2013.
