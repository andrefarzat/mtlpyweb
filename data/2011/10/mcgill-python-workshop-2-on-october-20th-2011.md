on October 20th, 2011 at McGill University. The first, highly successful
workshop focused on teaching the basics of the Python language. This
time, instructors Prof. Derek Ruths and myself (Mathieu Perreault) will
focus on teaching attendees how to write simple yet very powerful
programs while **only** using the standard Python libraries. Where: Room
