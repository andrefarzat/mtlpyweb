<!--:en-->Last week, Mathieu Perreault and Derek Ruths gave the [second
McGill Python Workshop][]. With around 40 attendees, the event was
definitely a success and you should expect another workshop soon.

<p>
Derek [lets us know][]:

> We showcased a number of libraries that ship with Python including
> support for working with SQLite databases, pickling objects, reading
> and writing CSV files, building well-formed command-line tools, and
> constructing applications with a full graphical user interface!

That's a nice series of events to keep an eye on.<!--:-->
