Let me tell you a story… Two years ago, I embarked on this great
adventure starting [a company][], raising high my Python sword and
slashing all the challenges that I would face during my journey.

</p>

This feeling that warms you up when someone finds your code so useful
that they will pay money for it is amazing.

</p>

Starting a company is much more than that though; it’s the opportunity
to talk to people and to use your empathy to figure out what they really
want; it’s the opportunity to decide all by yourself what kind of crazy
new software development methodologies you’re going to use; it’s the
opportunity to write code that is 100% tested — or not waste anytime on
those stinking tests that only slow you down; it’s the opportunity to
take the the phone and to learn the hard way how to close a sale (a
skill that will serve you well for years to come in many aspects of your
life, from negotiating a business deal to dating).

</p>

Starting a company is stressful, yes, but it’s a lot of fun. [Founder
Fuel][] is an exciting local initiative that gives an average of \$20k
to new startups and helps them grow by nurturing them with skilled
mentoring and a very influential network of contacts.

</p>

In the four months of the program, the companies are are expected to
grow from essentially nothing into usable and marketable products.

</p>

The first round of startups presented their products last Tuesday during
the demo day, and it was very exciting to see how far many of those went
during such a short time.

</p>

The second round is [now open][] to applications, and you have until
January 7th to [submityour startup idea][]. In the first round, not a
single startup had a strong Python presence.

</p>

Will we see more Python companies this time?

</p>

Let’s try to make it happen!
