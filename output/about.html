<h3>Mission</h3>
<p>Montréal-Python's mission is to promote the growth of a lively and
dynamic community of users of the Python programming language and to
promote the use of the latter.</p>
<p></p>
Montréal-Python also aims to disseminate the local Python knowledge to
build a stronger developer community.</p>
<p>Montréal-Python promotes Free and Open Source Software, favors its
adoption within the community, and collaborates with community players
to achieve this goal.</p>
<h3>Activities</h3>
<p>We have regular meetings consisting of several short presentations
followed by a longer main presentation. Everyone if free to attend and
we often have snacks and drinks to foster a climate where discussions
are welcome and appreciated. No particular skill level is required to
enjoy the meetings since there is often a presentation for everyone,
from new comers to experts.</p>
<p></p>
Beside the regular meetings, we often organize code sprints and informal
gatherings. We are also part of the core organization team of the
<a href="http://confoo.ca/en/">ConFoo conference</a>.</p>
<h3>Contact</h3>
<p>We have a <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/montrealpython" title="MontrealPython google group">mailing list</a> which is relatively low volume, but has an
extremely high signal to noise ratio.  We also meet on irc, in
