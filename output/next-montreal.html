<p>The technology scene of Montréal is a very vibrant one. With
groups such as our selves, OWASP, JS-Montreal, Montreal.rb, and
PHP-Québec; with events such as WordCamp, PodCamp, Startup Drinks, and
Startup Camp; you end up with weeks during which all your evenings are
booked before lunch time on Monday. Yet, it also happens that you have a
guest in town and that you want to show then how active you city is
without knowing where exactly you should take him to.</p>
<p>Fortunately, some members of the community decided to take the matter in
their own hands and to expose for all to see what is going on with the
tech and startup scene here in Montréal. <a href="http://nextmontreal.com">Next Montréal</a> is a blog
featuring news and opinion from the Web, mobile, and gaming communities.
The site is piloted by a <a href="http://nextmontreal.com/team/">handful of Montréal entrepreneurs</a>, engaging
us with interviews with the local players and giving us a good feel for
who's working on what and what's the next big thing. Beyond interviews,
Next Montréal brings together the community by posting job opportunities
and a calendar of events.</p>
<p>Next Montréal is a great initiative and we hope to see more Python
project <a href="http://nextmontreal.com/tag/python/">featured there</a>.<!--:--></p>
