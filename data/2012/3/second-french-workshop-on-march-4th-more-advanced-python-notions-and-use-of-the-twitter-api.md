Montréal-Python is proposing you to finally discover, in French this
time, your obsessions on Twitter (or those of others) by reading and
analysing Twitter feeds with Python. Yes finally, after more than 1
month of waiting in order to support the strike movement at the science
faculty of UQAM, the workshop will be held next week.

</p>

Since we would not force you to cross the picket line, we've asked for
help from our friends at Google Montréal: they are inviting us to their
offices next Wednesday, April 4th, to continue our Python introduction
workshop series.

</p>

Our workshops are open to all of you and are absolutely free. No need to
have attended the previous ones to come. Only a minimal knowledge of
Python is required (example: basic types).

</p>

Bring your laptop and try to install Python and ipython before the
workshop. If you have any issues, the Montréal-Python team will be there
to help you before the event (arrive early)

</p>

The installation procedure and all the needed informations about the
workshop is in the wiki page of the workshop at : [Atelier 2012-04-04 :
Python : notions plus avancées et exploitation de l'API Twitter][]
