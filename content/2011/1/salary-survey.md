Part of our mission here at Montréal-Python is to allow more hackers
work full time with Python. We're really happy with the state of the
Python job market in Montréal compared to how it was a few years ago but
too often, we hear about employers and job seekers who don't know what's
a fair remuneration for a Python developer.

[Glassdoor.com][] is a very useful industry survey of salaries and even
though it contains a lot of answers for Python positions, it's true that
not a lot of them are from people working here in Montréal. Maybe it's
time for some of us to share some information. Don't worry, it's
perfectly anonymous.
