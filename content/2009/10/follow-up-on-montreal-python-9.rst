Here is a follow-up on Montréal Python 9.

First, the video was uploaded to our `blip.tv channel`_. It's currently
queued for transcoding and should show up in the coming days.

Based on your feedback, we continue posting the slides and examples used
during the presentations. Our flash presenters were:

-  Simon Law: `Cygwinreg`_ and ctypes -- Using the Windows registry from
   Cygwin (`slides`_)
-  Mathieu Chartier: `ConFoo.ca`_ -- One of the largest Web development
   conference in North-America
-  Sébastien Pierre: Sink -- A tool to compare and keep directories in
   sync (`slides`_)
-  Erik Wright: Django Lean -- A tool for lean development and A/B
   testing (`slides`_)
-  Alexandre Vassalotti: Memory profiling for Python programs
   (`slides`_, `example`_)
-  Hugo Boyer: PyCUDA -- High performance computation using graphic
   cards (`slides and examples`_)

Our main presenter was *Andrew Francis* on *Stackless Python*
(`slides`_).

Montréal-Python is a co-organizer of the `ConFoo.ca`_ conference and
we'd like remind you that there is little less than four weeks to submit
a talk proposal.

Also, there will be a BarCamp with a presentation on AppEngine at
`Station C`_ on 2009-10-29. It would be a good occasion to have a small
informall Python gathering.

Finally, we would like to thank our sponsors for Montréal Python 9:

-  gold: `Département d'Informatique de l'UQAM`_
-  bronze: `O'Reilly`_ and `AESS`_
