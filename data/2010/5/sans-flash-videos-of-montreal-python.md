<!--:en-->At last, you can go watch the videos of the Montréal-Python
presentations, including the lightning talks, on the dedicated
[presentations page][]. So far, we have:

-   [Montréal-Python 1][] David Goodger on Polyform Puzzler
-   [Montréal-Python 2][] Cyril Robert on Scripting Asterisk with Python
    and Yannick Gingras on a live demo of PyQt and PyOpenGL
-   [Montréal-Python 7][] Olivier Bélanger on Ounk, an environment for
    musical scripting
-   [Montréal-Python 8][] Alexandre Vassalotti on Developing extension
    modules for CPython
-   [Montréal-Python 9][] Andrew Francis on Stackless Python
-   [Montréal-Python 10][] Chris Steel on Web2py

Each video is linked to a page on the [Montréal-Python wiki][] to give
the opportunity to presenters and attendees to gather interesting
material about the presentation, such as the slides, example code, and
related links. Now we need your feedback on the videos; Theora is quite
easy to deal with but H264 is a lot more tricky to transcode properly.
If you have trouble enjoying our videos, let us know.
