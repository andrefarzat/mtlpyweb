&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TP1 logo" src="http://www.tp1.ca/sites/all/themes/tp1/images/logo.png" /&gt; The second event in our series of Distutils2 sprints was
again a success. We've managed to fix some interesting issues and we've
gained some experience points at dealing with the black magic of the
packaging arcane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would like to thank &lt;a href="http://www.tp1.ca/"&gt;TP1&lt;/a&gt; for hosting the sprint at their nice
Downtown Montreal offices and also for the pizza. Pierre Paul, our host,
wrote &lt;a href="http://www.tp1.ca/en/node/559" title="Distutils2 coding sprint wrap-up"&gt;a longer post&lt;/a&gt; relating the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned for upcoming announcements on Distutils2 sprints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Special thanks to the sprinters:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Julien Courteau&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jonathan Fernandes&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Alex Parij&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kim Pettersen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Stay tuned this week for the announcement of the next sprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a glimpse of patches being born:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first &lt;a href="http://montrealpython.org/2012/03/distutils2-sprint/"&gt;Distutils2 sprint&lt;/a&gt;, held on the 21st of April at
&lt;a href="http://www.radialpoint.com/"&gt;RadialPoint's&lt;/a&gt; office, was a real success. That afternoon marked the
renewal of Montréal-Python's contributions to this vital project of the
Python ecosystem. Indeed, two years ago, sprints were organized here at
the very beginning of Distutils2, which aims to replace Distutils with a
more powerful tool that implements the new specs (PEPs) that all
packaging tools will comply with in the long term. We're pleased that a
dozen of volunteers were part of this first sprint! I spent some time
with every participant and I think everyone learnt something from the
sprint, be it knowledge on packaging, a first experience in free
software development or the writing test suites. I'd like to thank
everyone who came and opened Pandora's Box in order to fix bugs for the
benefit of the whole community. The complexity of the code explains the
fact that only two patches were done at the end of the sprint, but the
other patches started by the other participants could certainly be
completed during the next one. In order to keep the pace, a second
sprint will be held &lt;em&gt;Saturday the 12th of May&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href="http://www.tp1.ca/"&gt;TP1&lt;/a&gt; will host this
sprint and provide us with some pizza. Keep in mind that our deadline is
the release of the first beta version on the 24th of June. We have until
that point to close bugs and implement some useful features still
missing. &lt;strong&gt;Contributing to Distutils2 will help the whole Python
community. Be part of it!&lt;/strong&gt; Second Distutils2 Sprint:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Date: Saturday, 12th of May 2012, from 12:00 to 19:00&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Place: TP1, 1410 Stanley street, office 500 (&lt;a href="http://g.co/maps/c662j"&gt;map&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://next-distutils2-sprint.eventbrite.ca/"&gt;Registration&lt;/a&gt; is optional but recommended&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pythonistas, Distutils2 is looking for love, and you are the
group who are going to give it! The Montreal-Python user group is
hosting, on the 21st of April, a sprint in Montreal to work
on Distutils2 with Éric Araujo, Python core developer and distutils2
maintainer. Bring your laptop and your magic fingers, and we will
provide the food and the good times. No previous knowledge of Distutils2
required, just general Python skills. Distutils2 is the official
successor of distutils. It aims to be a better, more flexible and more
featureful packaging tool for Python authors, as well as a reusable
library for packaging tools developers. Distutils2 is included in the
Python 3.3 standard library under the name “packaging”, the module named
“distutils2” is the standalone backport for Python versions 2.5 to 2.7,
and 3.x. The first beta versions of Python 3.3 and Distutils2 are coming
in June, and we are planning a series of sprints to make it ready for
the release. A sprint is simply programmers meeting together
face-to-face to work on the same project. Previous sprints held in
Montreal have improved Distutils2, why don’t you come along for the next
one and put your mark on a Python release? The good folks at
Radialpoint have graciously provided us with space and free pizza. Come
join us on Saturday, the 21st of April, from 12pm to 7pm. The address
is: &lt;a href="http://g.co/maps/cuaxc"&gt;2050 Bleury Street Suite 300&lt;/a&gt; Registration &lt;a href="http://www.eventbrite.ca/event/3261945567"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; is preferable
but not required. For hacks and glory!&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>
