<li>Marco Robado: Introduction to the Sage symbolic math environment</li>
<li>Marcin Swiatek: Bioinformatics with Python</li>
</ul>
<p>Our main presenter will be <em>Chris Steel</em> and he's going to walk us
through <em>Universal Cake, a case study of using web2py for Web
development</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Universal Cake is that desert which taste good to everyone,
everywhere, at any time. In terms of software it is the perfect
application that comes in every language, is 100% accessible and is so
easy to use that it you are unaware of the complexities it hides. It
runs on any operating system and it does exactly what you want it to
do. An interface to our current mixed media of radio waves, sound
waves, electrons and increasingly photons, perhaps Marshall McLuhan
would have describe it as frosting, or even the "skin" on our shiny
new extended and now highly interconnected nervous system.</p>
<p>Chris has a numbingly long and exceedingly diverse employment history
that has become impossible to summarize. He currently provides
contract services to the LED R&amp;D branch of a medium sized US lighting
company where he helped deploy their first digital signage network. At
the moment, he is also in the process of launching a non-profit
organization dedicated to promoting "fair access" to social, political
and economic resources.</p>
<p>Originally from the Washington D.C. area, he grew up in a tiny town
that was full of journalists, scientists, musicians, professors,
artists, lawyers and the most liberated mothers on the planet at the
time. As the forests and farmlands surrounding their tiny town where
bulldozed and the lakes filled in to create mega malls and shopping
centers our town maintained it's independence by regularly and
successfully battling to divert highways, national convenience store
chains, incinerators and other threats to the towns integrity.</p>
<p>Today, the front of most of the homes in the town still face the
gravel "walkways" and communal green spaces are full of deer who no
longer have any other place to go. The only clue that you are in the
center of a high density population center is that in addition to the
sound of the birds and children playing you can also hear the
distinctive hum of the nearby "outer beltway".</p>
