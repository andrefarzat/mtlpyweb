<!--:en-->As most of you know, we have been working pretty hard during
the last few months to get PyCon in Montréal. The Python Software
Foundation held, today the 13th of March 2011 at PyCon 2011, a Site
Selection Meeting to choose the host city for PyCon 2014 and 2015...
It's with great honour that we announce that *Montréal has WON the bid!*
On behalf of the whole crew, I have to say thanks to all of you, the
pythonistas of Montréal. If we were able to win this bid, it's because
we have awesome speakers, regular attendees, people who show up at the
pub, sprinters, free software hackers, and a whole bunch of very
enthusiastic people. What we did in here at PyCon, was simply to carry
your enthusiasm and your passion. You are the community of Montréal
pythonistas and we owe PyCon 2014 and 2015 to you. [![MP's org team in
