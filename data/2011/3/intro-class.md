<!--:en-->We are excited to announce the first ever *Introduction to
Programming with Python* class held in Montréal on May 3rd, 2011. This
class is intended for women, and is open to all, not just programmers.
The class is, as the title suggests, of an introductory nature, and will
consist of two parts. The first part introduces the fundamentals of
programming, as implemented in Python, and the second part will be a
hands-on session where you will get to take Python for a spin and bend
it to your will. See the wiki for [the outline and other information][].
The event is free to attend, but since there are space limitations,
please sign up using [the guest list][]. Also, please bring a laptop if
you can or make a pairing agreement beforehand. If you would like to
bring a male friend as a guest, by all means feel free. Looking forward
to seeing you there!
