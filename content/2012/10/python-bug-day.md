This Saturday, you have the opportunity of participating in the Python
Bug Day. How would you like to be one of the contributors of Python? If
you have ideas for improving parts of the official documentation, the
standard library, the language itself, or if you have a patch waiting
for a review that you would like to see committed, or if you just want
to come and fix an existing bug, it's your day!

</p>

Join us for an effort at closing some Python bugs and feature requests.
Get quick feedback on your patches and bugfixes, learn how to submit and
examine patches, and have fun chatting with the Python developers and
other contributors. You don’t need to know the CPython codebase or
process to join, just Python programming knowledge.

</p>

If you live in Montreal, come at Caravan to meet fellow hackers and take
part in a physical sprint! The address is 5334 de Gaspé; we'll be there
from 10:00 to 18:00.

</p>

**Please register at [http://mpbugday.eventbrite.ca/][]** to let us know
how many people to expect. People from around the world are welcome to
join the \#python-dev IRC channel to participate in the bug day.
