		<!--:en-->

<p>Yesterday evening concluded the first ever, tremendously
successful Montréal Python event exclusively for women, giving all
involved an intense 3 hour introduction to the world of programming.</p>
<p>[<img alt="" src="http://montrealpython.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/P5030182_small-300x225.jpg" title="P5030182_small" />][]</p>
<p></p>
The turnout was excellent, with over 70 people -- both men and women-
attending. The "rules" were simple: you had to be a woman, and if not,
you had to be invited. The range of students covered a wide spectrum,
from people who had never written a single line of code to people well
familiar with programming, coming however from different backgrounds and
languages.</p>
<p>[<img alt="" src="http://montrealpython.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/P5030177_small-300x225.jpg" title="P5030177_small" />][]</p>
<p></p>
The class was taught by Janina Szkut while a number of TAs from
throughout the Montréal programming community helped the attendees
install Python on their laptops and work through any problems with
exercises.</p>

<p></p>
Things started off gently with an overview of what's actually involved
in programming -- what a programmer does on a day-to-day basis- then
progressed quickly to Python itself, covering syntax, control
structures, types, and other fundamental language constructs.</p>
<p>[<img alt="" src="http://montrealpython.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/P5030121_small-300x225.jpg" title="P5030121_small" />][]</p>
<p></p>
The grand finale threw students into the midst of drawing using turtle
graphics with Swampy, writing programs to draw a myriad of shapes on
screen. The air was thick, exciting; the theoretical knowledge everyone
had spent the last two hours learning was now manifesting itself as
something tangible. The caves of Lascaux, the historical first
expression of visual art, could barely hold a candle. (actually, caves
can't hold candles, so...)</p>
<p>[<img alt="" src="http://montrealpython.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/P5030139_small-300x225.jpg" title="P5030139_small" />][]</p>
<p></p>
On conclusion, the enthusiasm of everyone involved was overwhelming;
those already programming were inspired by the elegance and simplicity
of Python, while those who took their first steps were intrigued by a
new world of possibilities. And of course, in the tradition of Montréal
Python, we all ended the evening with drinks at the local distillery,
networking, talking and inspiring each other to continue exploring the
intricate world that is programming.</p>
