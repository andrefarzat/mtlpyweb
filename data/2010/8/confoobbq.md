<!--:en-->This year again, [ConFoo][] is going to be a major conference
on Web development bringing together many of the local communities. To
celebrate this synergy, everyone is invited to ConFooBBQ, the BBQ for
developers and other actors of the Web. The BBQ will take place on
2010-09-11 starting at 1h00 PM. On the menu: hot-dogs, chips, salad,
soft-drinks, cookies, and lots of fun. In line with our beer inspired
events, Montréal-Python will bring a keg a Charmeuse de Serpents, a
special batch of India Pale Ale with a very assertive character. To help
us plan adequate supplies, please send an email to board@confoo.ca if
you plan to attend. Don't forget to mention if you come with others. If
you can't find the group once you're on the site, feel free to give the
crew a call: 1-888-679-8466 option 0. Details of the event:
