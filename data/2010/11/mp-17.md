<!--:en-->Montréal-Python 17 (code name Apotropaic Archeologist) will
take place in room PK-1620 of UQAM on Monday 2010-11-29. This is in the
[President-Kennedy building][]. Here is our schedule for the evening:

-   18h00: Doors open
-   18h20: Announcements
-   18h30: Flash presentations
-   19h00: Break
-   19h20: Main presentations
-   20h30: Discussions and refreshments at Benelux

The main presentation will be given by Sébastien Labbé and Franco
Saliola; it will showcase [Sage][], the math exploration environment for
Python.

> Sage is a free and open source software for mathematics. Featuring a
> growing worldwide community, its mission is to offer an alternative to
> commercial packages such as Maple and Mathematica. Slides will be in
> English and the presentation will be done in French or in English,
> depending on what the audience is more comfortable with. We will
> present an introduction to Sage (history, mission, community, links
> with Python). We will also perform a demonstration that will highlight
> projects born from Sage and now growing independently: the Notebook
> interface and the Cython language.

> Franco Saliola, professor of mathematics at UQAM, and Sébastien Labbé,
> PhD student in applied mathematics and computer science at the LaCIM
> of UQAM, are Sage developers since 2008.

The event is free to addend and not registration is required. Some
snacks will be provided but do not expect a complete meal. Thanks to our
