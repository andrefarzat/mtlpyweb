<!--:en-->How does a developer change the world? One function at a time.
This December the Notman House gives you a chance to join likeminded
others and hack for a greater good. The event is Random Hacks of
Kindness and it will be hosted this December 3rd and 4th. On the first
day, Montreal participants will be presented real-life problems by
representatives of Médecins Sans Frontières and the LIRNEasia think
tank. Once a problem chosen, your team will then have two days to create
a solution. In this feat you will not be alone. Thousands of people
world wide will be participating in [30 sister events][] along with you.
Participants in other cities will work on solutions to the problems of
their community or their organization. Here in Montreal, I (Dimitry
Zolotaryov) am looking for team-mates to represent Montreal-Python.
Developers, designers, engineers and social media people are all
welcome. Send me a message if you're interested in being part of an
enthusiastic team: dimitry@webit.ca. This is your chance to hack for
good. Won't you accept the challenge? Register Here:
