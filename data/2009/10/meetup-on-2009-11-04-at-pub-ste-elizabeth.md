<!--:en-->For the November meetup, we will gather in a pub for informal
Python discussions instead of doing the regular meetings with
presentations. We'll meet at [Pub Ste-Elizabeth][] next Wednesday
(2009-11-04) at 6 PM.

Don't forget about the AppEngine presentation at Station-C tonight and
we still have the TurboGears sprint in the pipe for 2009-11-27. <!--:-->
