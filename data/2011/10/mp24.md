Winter is coming, the terraces are closing but Montréal-Python is
gearing up for a new (most likely) epic meet! This time, we're moving
away from societal debates and we go back to Python's youth in us with a
special meet about video games. We're inviting you all to Harmonious
Hacks, Monday October 24th at UQAM (SH-R810) of Pavillon Sherbrooke.
Once again, we will be featuring numerous presentations of 5 and 20
minutes about our main theme. A snack will be served, but don't count on
a full meal. Here's our schedule for the night:

-   18h00: Opening
-   18h20: Announcements
-   18h30: First salvo
-   19h10: Pause
-   19h25: Second salvo
-   20h30: Discussions and refreshments at Benelux

Our harmonious presenters will be:

-   Jeff Preshing from Ubisoft Montréal: "Python in the gaming industry"
-   Derek Mounce, "Fabulous mobile development with and without Python"
-   Jonathan Lessard: "Rapid Prototyping for games in Python with
    Blender"
-   Pierre Bourgault of Quazal
-   Nicolas Cadou, Nicholas Asch and Alice Bevan-McGregor, "The Inferno:
    an exercise in balancing Heaven and Earth while building
    the Bachelor Facebook game"

As usual, we are happy to count on our numerous sponsors, who are
generously involved with their local Pythonista group:
