<!--:en-->Pythonistas, let's continue our magnificent journey on the
Pythonic Way. It's now time to dive head first in web development using
Django, a Python web framework. Our last workshop [1] of the Winter 2012
series will show you that "Beautiful is better than ugly" and that
"Simple is better than complex". -- [Zen of Python][]

The Montréal-Python Rugby League (MPRL) [DoesNotExist] cruelly needs a
web app to manage its teams and its season. In only 3 hours, we'll make
this happen.

Let's code this together Wednesday on May 2nd at McGill University.

-   Date : 2012-05-02 from 6:00 PM to 9:00 PM
-   Place : McGill, Rutherford Building, room 118 3600 University Street

The workshop will be in English but all nations are welcome. No need to
know rugby nor having attended previous workshop. Our workshops are free
and open to all.

[1] We originally planned 4 workshops for this Winter 2012 series, but
supporting the student strike movement made us reorganize things. Lucky
you, you might see yourself following the 4th workshop in the very first
Montréal-Python Summer Workshop series!
