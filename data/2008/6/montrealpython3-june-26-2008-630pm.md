MontrealPython3 will be held June 26 2008 @ 6:30PM. Weâ€™ll be meeting at
Standout Jobs : 3981 boul. St. Laurent, Suite 615, Montreal. Going
forward, we will do one presentation per meetup. This will be more
convenient for lots of people, who have to leave before the end and feel
bad about it... Our presenter will be Martin Blais, who will give one of
his proposed presentations **(Snakefood / Beancount)**. <!--more-->PS.
There will not be another huge gap between events... To make sure this
is credible, we have set the next date already : July 31st. Hopefully,
Hugo Boyer will be the presenter for MP4 and talk to us about "Using
python to make real objects".
