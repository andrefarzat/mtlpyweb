MontrealPython4 - we will not be meeting this Thursday which was the
tentative date for our next meetup. We're working on the next event and
it'll be late in August / beginning of September.

The next meetup is likely to be fun : new location, more people, python
code that leads to objects. We just need more time to organize it
properly.
