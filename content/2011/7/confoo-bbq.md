<!--:en-->Once again, Montréal-Python is proud to join the organization
of the ConFoo conference on Web development and to celebrate Montréal
and its strong tech community.

More then ever, the great summer is the perfect occasion to meet the
people behind the various platforms and communities of the Web here in
Montréal. Yes, ConFoo is a joint project by several communities, among
others, Python, PHP, Ruby, Java, and Web standards.

It will also be the occasion to taste the delightful creation of a
brewer from the Python community: Jean Schurger will share with us
"Malted Banded Coral Snake", a very Pythonic India Pale Ale. Will we get
to also taste a Ruby red? A espresso Java Stout?

**The plan:**

ConFooBBQ starts at **1h00 PM Saturday August 6th** at **Beaver Lake**
near the Smith Mansion on Mount-Royal.

Please help us to make sure that there will be enough glasses and enough
food by registering on [EventBright][]. Don't forget to mention how many
persons will be in your group.

Once on-site, if you can't find the group, simply call 1-888-679-8466
then select option 0.
