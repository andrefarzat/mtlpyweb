   <p>

We are back, with a new location and a cool presentation in store for
you. Thursday September 25th @ 18h30 at **`http://labanque.ca/`_** - 175
Roy `Map`_. Our presentation will be from Hugo. Here is the intro.

    Python for the machinist

    In this presentation, I will show you how I use Python to create
    physical objects, circuits and machine elements. This presentation
    will walk you through simple python programs that generate
    instructions for CNC (Computer Numerical Control) equipment, and
    include a live demo where a 'useful' object will be created on a
    personal milling machine. There should be ample time left for an
    interesting technical discussion to follow.

We will have refreshments available (beer, soda) as well as some food.
