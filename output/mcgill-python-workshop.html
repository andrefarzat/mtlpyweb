<p>On Wednesday March 23rd was held the first of what is sure to be a
series of Python workshops held at McGill University. Organized by
Professor Derek Ruths and I of Ruths Research
(<a href="http://ruthsresearch.org">http://ruthsresearch.org</a>), the workshop attracted more than 80
attendees, most of them students from McGill University.</p>
<p>The purpose of this first Python workshop was to introduce attendees to
the simplicity of working with the language. Professor Ruths started the
session by talking about some of the reasons people are choosing Python
over other languages: easiness in learning the language, the amazing
power it has under the hood and the speed with which one can go from
idea to prototype. He then introduced the containers that are built in
to the language (list, dict, set, tuple) and presented ways that code
can be made simpler and more readable using standard methods on these
containers.</p>
<p>I then built, in front of the audience, an application that interfaced
with the Twitter API. This allowed me to introduce great modules that
are offered with Python: urllib and json. Attendees were guided through
the steps of working with an API (from reading the documentation to
making a GET request) and shown how simple it is to get from an idea to
a working Python program in less than 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Overall the organizers were quite pleased with the event and plan to
organize more of them in the future. Materials from this last event can
be found on their website (<a href="http://ruthsresearch.org/mpw">http://ruthsresearch.org/mpw</a>).<!--:--></p>
