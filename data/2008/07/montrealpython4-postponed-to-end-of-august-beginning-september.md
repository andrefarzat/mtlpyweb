MontrealPython4 - we will not be meeting this Thursday which was the
tentative date for our next meetup. We're working on the next event and
it'll be late in August / beginning of September. The next meetup is
likely to be fun : new location, more people, python code that leads to
objects. We just need more time to organize it properly.
