We have the pleasure to announce that Montreal Python 5 will be on
2009-02-26 at [La Banque][].

The main presentation will be Alexandre Vassalotti on Porting your Code
to Python 3: *Python 3, also colloquially known as Python 3000, is now
out for general use. Unfortunately, its usage is limited since only a
few libraries are currently compatible with Python 3. In this
presentation, you will learn a straightforward process for migrating
Python code and the common difficulties related to the transition. In
addition, an overview of the new features brought by Python 3 will be
described with practical examples. Finally, upcoming changes and
features in Python 2.7 and 3.1 will be presented.*

*Alexandre Vassalotti is a contributing Python core developer and a
computer science student at McGill University. He was a successful
participant of Google Summer of Code 2007, for which he worked on the
different aspects of Python 3.0.*

The main presentation should be from 45 to 60 minutes. Before the main
presentation, there will be a few flash (5 mins) presentation. We still
have open spots for the flash presentation so don't hesitate to send us
your idea for a flash presentation.

La Banque is located at 175 Roy. See you there.
