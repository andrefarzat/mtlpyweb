room PK-5115 of the President-Kenedy building. The PK building is

-   19h00: Break
-   19h20: Main presentation

Our main presenter will be Andrew Francis and he is going to walk us
through his Survey of Stackless Python:

> Over the years, Stackless Python has acquired a mystical reputation,
> mostly based around its micro-thread implement and its use in a really
> big MOORPG. Otherwise, relatively little is known about Stackless
> Python. I would like to change this...

> In this talk, I will discuss what is Stackless Python and its
> relationship to Python. I will give an overview of key Stackless
> Python concepts. Special attention will be devoted to network
> programming. I will finish the talk with a mention of my own Stackless
> work and Stackless Python's future. Throughout the talk, I will
> suggest that Stackless Python true strength is not the performance of
> its concurrency model but rather its simplicity that gives insights as
> to what a Pythonic concurrency model would look like.

Living in Montreal, Andrew Francis has an academic background in the
humanities, computer science, and management. Professionally, Andrew has
worked at companies such as BNR, Omnimark, and Adobe Systems in
California. Ever since 2005, Andrew has been playing with Stackless
Python, as a part of his work with WS-BPEL, and he has never looked
back! At Pycon 2008, Andrew gave the talk "Adventures in Stackless
Python/Twisted Integration." We still have a lot of open slots for flash
presentations so don't hesitate to propose a talk. Also, our speaker
pool is running low so please get in touch with us if you have an idea
for a main presentation.
