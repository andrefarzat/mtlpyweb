<!--:en-->PHP-Québec, Montréal-Python, Ruby Montréal, W3Qc, and OWASP
Montréal are organizing the first edition of the [ConFoo.ca
conference][], which will be held in Montréal on March 10th through 12th
at the Hilton Bonaventure Hotel. With over 500 expected attendees,
[ConFoo.ca][ConFoo.ca conference] is one of the the largest Web
development conference in North America. We are looking for the best
speakers willing to share their experience and skills with programmers,
managers, marketers and decision makers. The conference is divided into
two parts:

-   A technical part, encompassing different aspects of Web development:
    PHP, Python, Ruby, security, project management, CMSs and
    frameworks, databases, systems administration, Web standards,
    accessibility and agile methods.
-   A decision-making part: referencing (SEO), Web marketing analysis,
    and social networking.

Presenters can decide to present in English or French. Presentations are
roughly one hour long and these may be recorded for later broadcast in
digital format. All relevant details concerning the conference are
available on the [call for speaker website][]. Even though Python can be
used for a wide range of programming tasks, the Python track at
ConFoo.ca will focus on Web development with Python. For all the other
fascinating aspects of Python, do not hesitate to submit a talk to
[PyCon][], which is also running its call for speakers as I write this.
