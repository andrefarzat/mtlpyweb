<!--:en-->The core Python packaging team is going to be [sprinting on
distutils2][] from Thursday 2011-01-27 to Sunday 2011-01-30. We don't
want to be left behind so we plan to join them with a gathering on
Saturday 2011-01-29. We expect to be hacking between 11h AM and 8h PM.
The location will be announced shortly but we expect an attendance cap
between 12 and 20 hackers so don't forget to [RSVP on the wiki][].
