Attendance at the [second packaging sprint][] was very good with a total
of eight showing up:

-   Pior Bastida
-   Alexandre Bourget
-   Nicolas Cadou
-   Yannick Gingras
-   Mathieu Leduc-Hamel
-   George Peristerakis
-   Cyril Robert
-   Jean Schurger

[Tarek][] was kind enough to coach the beginning of the sprint remotely
and to produce a list of bugs that are not too hard to undertake and
that are not already assigned.

Unfortunately, it was not the most productive sprint that we've had. The
complicated state of the packaging in Python and the convoluted
Setuptools code made it hard for people to get started and all too
tempting to get side tracked on other computer related tasks, such as
demonstration of [Typeracer in instadeath mode][] and [Nethack][]
[strategy][] [coaching][]. I have to be honest; I deserve my share of
the blame.

As far as I can tell, no one got to go beyond making themselves familiar
with the code during the sprint proper but it's by learning from our
mistakes that we progress. We therefor plan to have the next packaging
sprint on a Saturday in order to make it easier to sync with Tarek. Our
tentative date is 2010-05-22. Hopefully, we'll be able to gather enough
local knowledge to have local coach for the subsequent sprints. One
thing that is sure is that for future code sprints, we will ensure that
there is an expert on site.
