Next Thursday, MTLStartupTalent, will showcase what Montreal has to
offer best.

They already have a great selection of startups looking for talent:
CakeMail, Ziliko, 2XM Interactive, Crescendo, Pheromone, CrowdtTwist and
more.

There's some very great Pythonisthas out there that we would like to
celebrate.

As such:

-   are you a talent?
-   what amazing things are you doing?
-   which achievements are you the most proud of?

</p>
In front of a large crowd, come tell us why you are so proud of your
preferred language and community. Did you win at a recent Startup
Weekend? Is your github project forked by many others? Did you win a
design award? Are you a star on Twitter? Do you want to present a
weekend project you’re proud of?

We want to celebrate all those small and big achievements that makes
Montréal a great city for innovation and creativity. And the Python
community is definitely part of it.
