&lt;p&gt;We have found a location for our next packaging sprint
(2011/01/29), it will be at LeSite's office! Here are the coordinates:
Le Site 381, Notre-Dame west, suite 200 Corner of McGill or St-Pierre
Metro Square Victoria There will be beer -of course- and also coffee,
food, beanbags, and even a giant TV with a PS3 if you want to take a
small fifa break :)&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Packaging Sprint #11</title><link href="http://montrealpython.org/packaging-sprint-11.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-01-12T23:26:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Ygingras</name></author><id>tag:montrealpython.org,2011-01-12:packaging-sprint-11.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;!--:en--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core Python packaging team is going to be &lt;a href="http://tarekziade.wordpress.com/2011/01/11/distutils2-sprint/"&gt;sprinting on
distutils2&lt;/a&gt; from Thursday 2011-01-27 to Sunday 2011-01-30. We don't
want to be left behind so we plan to join them with a gathering on
Saturday 2011-01-29. We expect to be hacking between 11h AM and 8h PM.
The location will be announced shortly but we expect an attendance cap
between 12 and 20 hackers so don't forget to &lt;a href="http://wiki.montrealpython.org/index.php/Packaging_no.11"&gt;RSVP on the wiki&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Packaging Sprint #6 wrap-up</title><link href="http://montrealpython.org/packaging-sprint-6-wrap-up.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-07-23T17:13:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Ygingras</name></author><id>tag:montrealpython.org,2010-07-23:packaging-sprint-6-wrap-up.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;!--:en--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last Thursday, we ran our 6th sprint on the Python packaging system.
Most people worked on distutils2 and its test suite although a few were
undertaking the implementation of new features in the 2to3 automated
migration tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sprint was a turning point in our sprint series because we managed
to get enough notoriety to convince two sprinter to join us remotely
despite a massive six hours timezone difference. Alexis Métaireau and
Éric Araujo, both living in France and both Google summer of code
students on the Python packaging system, joined us util the end of the
sprint, around 7am in their timezone. Their participation was very
helpful since they were able to answer many questions regarding the
road-map and what was in the pipe for various sub-systems of the
packaging eco-system. Since they both the commit privilege in the
canonical repository, it was very motivating for everyone in Montréal to
see their contributions being merged on the fly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to all the sprinter who resisted the call of the
terraces to work on the Python packaging system:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Éric Araujo (remote from France)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nicolas Cadou&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alex Gal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yannick Gingras&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alexis Métaireau (remote from France)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;George Peristerakis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Luis Rojas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will have more sprint in the coming weeks. Stay tuned for the
announcements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last sprint was &lt;a href="http://montrealpython.org/2010/07/packaging-sprint-5-wrap-up/"&gt;a productive one&lt;/a&gt;, yet we left with a few
outstanding issues. In order to correct those while everything is still
fresh in our mind, we don't waste anytime and go for another sprint on
the Python packaging system this Thursday, 2010-07-15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sprint will be at &lt;a href="http://ajah.ca/blog"&gt;Brasseurs Numériques&lt;/a&gt;, 1124 Marie-Anne, suite
11, starting at 6h30 pm and going as long as there are hackers standing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bring your own laptop or make an arrangement for pairing on the mailing
list beforehand. Attendance is limited to 12 persons so please &lt;a href="http://wiki.montrealpython.org/index.php/Packaging_no.6"&gt;RSVP on

&lt;p&gt;Last Monday was a hot and sticky day here in Montréal, one of
these days when air feels as dense as molasses, when grocery stores run
out of ice cream. Yet, a handful of brave Pythonistas decided to brave
the heat and to head out to &lt;a href="http://ajah.ca/blog"&gt;Brasseurs Numériques&lt;/a&gt; for the fifth
Montréal-Python &lt;a href="http://montrealpython.org/2010/07/packaging-sprint-5/"&gt;sprint on the Python packaging system&lt;/a&gt;. The turn out
was a bit low compared with previous sprints but this is easily
explained by the many regulars who are traveling abroad during the
summer. We were also happy to welcome a few new comers. We took a moment
at the white-board to review what was the state of the Python packaging
and to define the aspects on which everyone could be contributing. Alex
and Nicolas worked on improving the test coverage in distutils2, a very
good way of getting familiar with the code while diving in right away;
I, Yannick, gave them a hand by adding test coverage reports as a
command line option to the test runner; George and Pior worked on 2to3
migration fixers and on the related test suite; and Davin improved the
Hitchhiker's Guide to Packaging while Michel helped him by packaging a
package of his own while following the guide, making sure that the
documentation was clear and obvious. Thanks to the sprinters:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Davin Baragiotta&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pior Bastida&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nicolas Cadou&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alex Gal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Michel Gallant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yannick Gingras&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;George Peristerakis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also want to personally thank everyone for taking the time to clean
their glasses and plates as they were leaving. It was refreshing not to
have to do most of the cleanup myself at 1am. We're becoming productive
during our sprints. One thing that we overlooked when we started
sprinting at Montréal-Python is how important it is to have a coach,
that is, someone who knows the project reasonably well and who will
answer questions from other sprinters. Theoretically, a bunch of hackers
could work together, dive in, pry open, and figured out a project as
they go. In practice, that does not work very well for a sprint since
you get a bunch of people who are not used to work together and the kind
of close communication that you need for pair investigation does not
have time to kick in during the relatively short sprint. As people are
waiting for the investigators to come up with answers to their
questions, their excitement dissipates and they get kicked out of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)"&gt;the
zone&lt;/a&gt;. Another thing that really helps is to have possible tasks with
a wide range of difficulty to allow anyone to get busy. An example of
great introductory task, as mentioned earlier, is writing unit-test.
This requires that setting up a working test environment and producing a
coverage report is straight forward and this is what a someone should
keep in mind before launching a sprint on a given project. As it takes
some time to setup and to get focussed, one way to improve productivity
is to have longer sprint. Hacking during the week-end, especially during
nice summer days, is not very popular but dedicated hackers will show
up. A good balance between week-days and weekend sprints is key here.
Another way to improve is to nail down as many "boiler plate" tasks as
possible before the sprint: creating all the Bitbucket accounts and
distributing the necessary privileges, assigning tasks, or even setting
up a working tests environment. We have to thank the Python Software
Foundation for &lt;a href="http://pythonsprints.com/2010/07/4/our-first-sponsored-sprint-montreal-python-packagi/"&gt;supporting the sprint&lt;/a&gt; by covering the cost of food
and drinks. Fuel (food and drinks), is not a requirement for a sprint
since dedicated hackers will show up whether they have to bring their
own booze or not, but it's nice to be able to reward sprinters with a
savory meal. They deserve it. The &lt;a href="http://pythonsprints.com/"&gt;sprint sponsorship program&lt;/a&gt; is a
great thing, not because there is a financial bottleneck to organizing
sprint, but because having a common coordinator for Python sprint will
help to share the excitement and the knowledge of what works for sprints
and what doesn't. Hopefully, other user groups will join us and make
sprints a core element of their schedule.

&lt;p&gt;Summer is going strong with lots of good opportunities for
terraces but we know that beer always feel better after accomplishing
something great. This is why we will have a fifth sprint on the Python
packaging system next Monday, 2010-07-05. The sprint will be at
Brasseurs Numériques, 1124 Marie-Anne, suite 11, starting at 6h30 pm and
going as long as there are hackers standing. Bring your own laptop or
make an arrangement for pairing on the mailing list beforehand.
Attendance is limited to 12 persons so please &lt;a href="http://wiki.montrealpython.org/index.php/Packaging_no.5"&gt;RSVP on the wiki&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;strong&gt;update:&lt;/strong&gt; We thank the &lt;a href="http://www.python.org/psf/"&gt;Python Software Foundation&lt;/a&gt; for supporting
our sprinting effort by supplying food and drinks. You probably recall
that not long ago, the PSF &lt;a href="http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2010/06/psf-sponsored-sprints.html"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that it would start a sprint
sponsorship program. Montréal-Python is honored to be the first
recipient of the program.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Packaging Sprint #4</title><link href="http://montrealpython.org/packaging-sprint-4.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-05-24T20:40:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Ygingras</name></author><id>tag:montrealpython.org,2010-05-24:packaging-sprint-4.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;!--:en--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We learned a lot from &lt;a href="http://wiki.montrealpython.org/index.php/Sprints"&gt;past sprints&lt;/a&gt; and we want to keep our
momentum so without waiting, we launch a 4th sprint on the Python
packaging system. The sprint will be on 2010-06-02 starting at 18h. It's
likely to be at Brasseurs Numériques' but we also have an altenate
location in sight. One way or the other, attendance will be limited to
around 12 to 18 hackers so &lt;a href="http://wiki.montrealpython.org/index.php/Packaging_no.4"&gt;RSVP on the wiki&lt;/a&gt;. Bring your laptop or
make a pairing arrangement on the mailing list beforehand. We don’t have
any sponsors for this sprint, but this won’t stop us. Bring your
refreshments and expect a group order for food around 7pm.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Third packaging sprint wrap-up</title><link href="http://montrealpython.org/third-packaging-sprint-wrap-up.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-05-24T19:21:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Mlhamel</name></author><id>tag:montrealpython.org,2010-05-24:third-packaging-sprint-wrap-up.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;!--:en--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third packaging sprint was a clear success: we closed
tickets, seven sprinters showed up, and everyone got to commit
something. Congratulation to all the sprinters:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pior Bartida&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nicolas Cadou&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yannick Gingras&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mathieu Leduc-Hamel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;George Peristerakis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cyril Robert&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tarek Ziadé (remote)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were also lucky to have Tarek Ziadé in voice conference from the
other side of the Atlantic, which really jump-started our motivation.
Tarek gave us an overview of the state of the packaging, he did put the
various tickets in a wider context, and gave some orientation to our
strategy. Over all, it was a very good sprint with work that got done
on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distutils2, the next generation of distutils&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distribute, the temporary replacement for setuptools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PyPI, the website that aggregates Python packages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The motivation is high and we keep going with our momentum. Therefore,
without waiting any longer, we already launch the next sprint. It will
be on 2010-06-02 starting at 6 pm. Stay tuned to know the location.
