<!--:en-->Montreal-Python and the UQAM Computer Science Student
Association (AGEEI) are proud to present their very first French open
attendance Django Workshop. Last week, we introduced Python through a
dynamic workshop and we will now dive head first in web development
using the Django Python framework. You only need to have a basic
knowledge of the Python language in order to participate (if you have
assisted to our first workshop, you're good to go). The evening will be
animated by Davin Baragiotta of Agence Universitaire de la Francophonie
(AUF) and will be split up in two parts: \* Web development with Python
and Django: an overview of a typical project architecture \* Street
Hockey League: we will be working on a little sample Django project The
workshop will be next Thursday, on December 1st at the Sherbrooke
building of UQAM, room SH-R810 from 6h30pm to 9pm. More info can be
found about the event at:
