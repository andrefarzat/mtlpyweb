		<!--:en-->

<p>Hi <strong>Montréal-Python</strong> Users!</p>
</p>

<p>The <strong>PyCon organizers</strong> are happy to announce that ticket sales for the
March 2013 conference have opened at
<a href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/registration/">https://us.pycon.org/2013/registration/</a> ! Early bird rates are
available for the first 1000 purchases, which is a departure from
previous time-based systems. With <strong>PyCon 2012</strong> having been a quick
sell out, we're expecting this one to be the same. Keep in mind that
attendance is strictly limited to <strong>2500</strong>.</p>
</p>

<p><strong>PyCon 2013</strong> is going back to Santa Clara, CA before heading up north
for two years in <strong>Montreal, Quebec for 2014-15</strong>. The event starts with
two days of tutorials on March 13, followed by three days of talks
starting March 15, and ends with four days of sprints starting March 18.</p>
</p>

<p>Individual and corporate ticket prices remain the same as they have been
for the last few years, with early bird rates of \$300 and \$450
respectively. The regular rates of \$350 and \$600 for individual and
corporate are still an incredible deal.</p>
</p>

<p>For 2013 we've reduced the cost to students by 50%, bringing the early
bird rate to \$100 with a regular rate of \$125. Providing a more
affordable conference experience for students is a priority for the
organizers and the <em>Python Software Foundation</em>, and we're hoping the
decrease helps bring more of them out.</p>
</p>

<p>We've also increased our financial aid program, and hope to assist more
attendees for <strong>PyCon 2013</strong>! You can apply for financial aid through
the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?fromEmail=true&amp;formkey=dGt4Z0dsY052VERJem4xUUFVQW9uQVE6MQ">new consolidated form</a></p>
</p>

<p>We're still accepting proposals for talks and tutorials, with a deadline
of September 28. Poster proposals are accepted through January 15, 2013.
