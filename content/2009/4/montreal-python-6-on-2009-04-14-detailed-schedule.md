As you hopefully know by now, Montreal Python 6 is this Tuesday at [la
Banque][]. Here is our schedule for the evening:

-   18h00: Opening
-   18h45: Announcements and flash presentations
-   19h15: Break
-   19h45: Main presentation: Francis Piéraut on Machine Learning
    empowered by Python

Flash presenters will be:

-   Nathanaël Lécaudé: PyMT: module for developing multi-touch enabled
    applications
-   Stéphane Jolicoeur How Python is used at the National Film Board of
    Canada
-   Alexandre Bourget SFL Vault: a secure distributed crediential
    storage system
-   Herald Gjura The challenge of managing a horde of Pythonistas
-   François Pinard Tweeting with Python
-   Olivier Bélanger Ounk: a Python audio scripting environment for
    Csound; pitch for Montréal Python 7

In case you missed the original announcement, here is the abstract for
the main presentation:

> Machine Learning is a subfield of AI that considers learning patterns
> from existing data. Related applications are increasing in many fields
> where adaptive systems are needed, like fraud detection, face
> recognition, recommendation systems, disambiguation systems, insurance
> risk estimation, web traffic filtering, voice recognition, and many
> others.
>
> </p>
> The first part of this presentation will cover the basics of machine
> learning; in the second part, we will dive into a real example and see
> the complete process of using machine learning to create a real-time
> digit recognition system using Mlboost, a python library. The
> practical approach should allow the audience to assimilate the most
> important concepts of machine learning and the critical need for data
> preprocessing.
>
> <p>
> After a Software Engineer degree, Francis Piéraut made a research
> master in Machine Learning at LISA. During his research work, he
> developed flayers, a powerful C++ neural network library. During the
> beginning of his career, his spend several years in Montreal startups
> companies applying Machine Learning and statistical AI related
> solutions. In 2005, he released the first version of MLboost, a python
> library that allows him to speedup his Machine Learning projects by
> simplifying data preprocessing, features selection and data
> visualization.

See you there.
