<!--:en-->There is a now a google calendar for MP! You can search google
calendar for it, but it's also embedded here:
[http://montrealpython.org/event-calendar/][] Where you can easily
subscribe to it on google cal. If you use another calendar, you can
subscribe to MP with the following links: \* [xml][] \* [ical][] \* or
just [see the calendar in its own page][] We'll keep it up to date with
links to the event announcements as well as the location and date - this
will be the canonical source of information for where and when things
are happening in MP.
